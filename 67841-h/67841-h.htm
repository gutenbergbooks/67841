<p>California has but few characteristic archaeological remains
such as are found in the mounds of the Mississippi valley or the
ancient pueblos and cliff-dweller ruins of the South. In the shellmounds
along this section of the Pacific coast it possesses, however,
valuable relics of very ancient date. These are almost the
only witnesses of a primitive stage of culture which once obtained
among the early inhabitants of this region.</p>

<p>Some years ago Professor Merriam recognized the necessity of
exploring these ancient mounds and represented the facts to the
University of California. Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst generously
made the undertaking possible by providing ample financial support
for the exploration work.</p>

<p class='caption'>Plate 1: Map of the east shore of San Francisco Bay in the vicinity of Berkeley, showing the location of the Emeryville Shellmound with several others in this region. Scale: 1 inch = about three miles.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the largest and best preserved shellmounds was selected
as the object of the present investigation, which was entrusted
to Professor Merriam and the writer. The mound selected is situated
on the eastern side of the Bay of San Francisco at Shellmound
Station near Emeryville, and is commonly known as the
Emeryville mound. At present it forms a conspicuous feature
of the recreation grounds known as Shellmound Park (<a href='#pl1'>pl. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The water of the bay rises to within 130 feet of the base of
the mound (<a href='#pl3'>pl. 3</a>) during high tide. The beach is then only one
foot above the water level, while the ground in the immediate
vicinity of the mound is from two to three feet higher. This
ground is quite level and forms a part of an extensive alluvial
flat. A small creek, having its source about three miles away, in
the hills back of Berkeley, passes the mound on its south side, at
a distance of two hundred feet, and empties into the bay. In
summer the creek runs dry, but its bed furnishes a channel for
subterranean water. Another, lower mound, containing graves,
lay on the site of the Emeryville race-track near by, but it has
been leveled down during the construction of the track. The
shellmound which was the object of the excavation has the form
of a truncated cone, with a diameter of 270 feet at its base and
145 feet at the top, and rising 27 feet above the plain. On the
north side its foot extends 100 feet farther over the flat, a few
feet higher than the level of the ground about it.</p>

<p>Twenty-five or thirty years ago the shore line of the bay lay
fifty feet farther out; a pile set at that time is still to be seen at
that distance from the beach. It is above the water during high
tide and marks the coast line on this side of which floodland was
sold by the State. The top of the mound was not at that time
crowned by the wooden pavilion which is there at the present
time. It was still ungraded, having its natural conical form, and
was covered with a wild growth of bushes and brambles. The
creek, as yet unregulated, followed its own course and overflowed
the land, causing it to become marshy. In the seventies and
eighties of the last century, railroad tracks were laid along the
eastern side of the mound, and took in a section of its eastern
foot. At that time a number of graves and Indian artifacts were
discovered. Few of these, however, found their way into the
collections of the University, then but recently founded.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span><h1><span class='sc'>Early Settlements in the Region.</span></h1></div>

<p>Fages, the first traveler who passed through the country, from
south to north, traveled along the eastern shore of the Bay of San
Francisco in 1774,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> and came upon Indian settlements where he
found a friendly welcome. His account of this expedition however,
fails to throw any light upon the question whether or not
the shellmounds were still occupied at that time. The neighboring
creek bears the name of “Temescal” from a region between
Berkeley and Oakland through which it passes.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> This name appears
to be a mutilation of the Nahua word “temazcalli,” hot-house,
the name of sweat-houses in Mexico, and the place may
have been so named by Mexicans living on the Bay, from an
Indian sweat-house standing there. Hence it may be assumed
that an Indian settlement was in existence on the banks of this
creek at a time from which the name could pass over into the
existing vocabulary.</p>

<p>Other evidences of early Indian settlements in this section of
the eastern shore country of the Bay are the shellmounds, twelve
of which may be found along the coast between Point Richmond
and Alameda in a stretch of twelve miles (<a href='#pl1'>pl. 1</a>). They may be
seen near Point Richmond upon the eastern side, facing the
peninsula, upon Brooks Island, near Ellis Landing, northeast
from Stege upon a marshy ground intersected by narrow channels,
near Seaver’s Ranch to the west from Stege, on Point Isabel,
in West Berkeley, in Emeryville, and in the eastern section of
Alameda between Mound, Central, and Lincoln avenues. There
is also said to have been one in East Oakland on the canal between
Oakland Harbor and Lake Merritt, but it has disappeared
owing to building over that section of ground. In all probability
many others may have met with a similar fate.</p>

<p>All these evidences of an early occupation of the country are
but a few of the mounds that skirt the Bay upon all sides, continuing
along Suisun Bay and the Sacramento and Feather rivers.
Besides these, there are numerous mounds dotting the coast land
of Northern California, those surrounding swamps and rivers
along the Tulare and Kern lakes in southern California,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> and
on the shore near Santa Cruz. Others are found in the regions
of San Luis Obispo,<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> of Santa Barbara,<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> and the islands opposite
that place.</p>

from Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in the river valleys of
nearly all the southern states (Charles C. Abbott, Primitive Industry, 1881,

<h2><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span><span class='sc'>The Nature of the Excavations.</span></h2>

<p>The work of exploration was commenced by Professor Merriam
and the writer in February, 1902, toward the end of the
rainy season, and was finished early in May. Captain Siebe, the
proprietor of Shellmound Park, gave all possible assistance in
the investigation. Owing to the presence of the circle of trees
around the truncated top of the mound it was necessary to confine
the excavations to a lateral section and a tunnel extending
from it toward the center of the mound. However desirable a
more extended section through the hill might have been, the results
obtained in these partial excavations are as a whole similar
to those which would have been obtained by a cut through the
entire mound.</p>

<p>The western slope of the mound, facing the bay, was selected
as the starting point for the operations. The entire work of excavation
may in a chronological order be divided into the following
four stages.</p>

<p><span class='it'>A.</span> The first lateral cutting in the mound. This was made
in the western foot of the mound, seven feet and a half above the
level of the bay and at a distance of fifty feet from the plateau.
The trench was two feet deep, eighteen feet long and six feet
wide, its floor sloped towards the center of the mound.</p>

<p><span class='it'>B.</span> Tunnel construction. The tunnel formed the underground
continuation of the trench; it was the means of reaching
the interior of the mound and down to its original base. Hence
the floor of the tunnel was made to slope steeply inward. The
tunnel was extended from the end of the trench A for forty-two
feet into the interior of the mound, and at its terminal point it
sank to two feet below the level of the bay. It was five feet wide
and six and a half feet high. Several distinct strata were cut
through by the tunnel section. Eleven feet of the length of the
tunnel extended under the plateau of the mound. This was still
sixty feet from the vertical center of the hill (<a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>), but the
observations made in this interior part of the mound were of
a relatively greater value than those of the outer zone. Many
difficulties were met during the construction of the tunnel, among
which the porosity of the soil was one of the worst. The tunnel
was therefore timbered and its sides sheathed. Another difficulty
was the ground water, of which there was often a very strong flow
when digging in the lower part of the tunnel. According to the
advance of the season, it was encountered at different depths, and
it grew less with the approach of summer. A small hand pump
was used to exhaust this water, but it barely answered the purpose,
and it was often with great difficulty that the inrushing
water could be mastered.</p>

<p><span class='it'>C.</span> The upper vertical cut of the entire mound. In order to
obtain a view of all the strata contained in the mound this section
was undertaken. The lowest parts of the mound having been
thoroughly explored by the construction of the tunnel, it was now
sufficient to make the upper sectional cut only as deep as the roof
of the tunnel, while its terminal point was fixed by the circle of
trees on the summit of the mound. Its greatest length from the
mouth of the tunnel was twenty-six feet. The sides of the cut
were sloped in order to prevent the fall of loose soil and to avoid
the cost of timbering. The length of this section at its lower end,
near <span class='it'>b</span> (<a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>), was reduced from 26 feet to 19 feet, and the width
to 10 feet along the entire foot of the trench from <span class='it'>a</span><a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> to <span class='it'>b</span>. In
<a href='#pl5'>pl. 5</a> there is shown the first cut into the mound, before it had been
made wider by five feet throughout its length. In making this cut
the earth was removed stratum by stratum. For want of other
marks of division, the dividing lines of the various strata (I to
VII) were chosen arbitrarily from the several visible lines of
structure, and they are marked in the diagram, <a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>, by asterisks.
In order to obtain a uniform classification of the contents of the
mound it was thought necessary to introduce the same lines of
division in the sectional diagram of the tunnel: objects found
there had been marked previously by the distance of their position
from the mouth of the tunnel and their relative height.
These strata in conformity with the numbering of the upper ones
were marked as numbers VII to X.</p>

<p><span class='it'>D.</span> A series of pits was dug from the foot of the tunnel out
to the bay shore. The pits were made in order to ascertain the
general outline of the base of the mound under the cuts already
made, as well as under the unexcavated portion of the mound
farther out toward its margin. The pits are marked as <span class='it'>h</span> in the
interior of the mound, and as <span class='it'>i</span>, <span class='it'>k</span>, <span class='it'>l</span>, <span class='it'>m</span>, toward its periphery.
The two pits <span class='it'>n</span> and <span class='it'>o</span><a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> are situated on the outside of the superficial
foot of the mound, at a distance of 35 feet and 67 feet from
the nearest pit, <span class='it'>m</span>. It was here seen that the terminal point of the
foot of the mound lay between the pits <span class='it'>n</span> and <span class='it'>o</span>, the pit near <span class='it'>n</span>
showing only the debris of the shellmound, while that near <span class='it'>o</span> revealed
nothing of it. These two pits were connected by a trench,
which gave an exceedingly interesting section of the margin of
the mound.</p>

</div>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><span class='sc'>The Base of the Mound.</span></h2>

<p>The mound consists mainly of a mass of broken or entire
shells, ashes, bits of charcoal, and some artifacts. This mass extends
far above the surface of the surrounding land and ends
two and a half feet below the level of the ground water and two
feet below the general tide level of the bay, and rests immediately
upon a sharply defined yellowish alluvial clay stratum. There is
no indication of a rocky elevation which might have served as an
inducement for the original settlement, and would have helped
to raise the mound to its present height. Some of the charcoal
and small boulders brought here by man rest upon the clay soil.
A slight discoloration of the upper line of the clay stratum may
have been caused by a transitory plant growth during some early
period, while there is no indication of a crust of good soil which
would be a sign of a longer period of vegetable growth upon it.</p>

<p>The base of the mound is horizontal according to all indications
gained between pits <span class='it'>h</span> and <span class='it'>m</span>. A slight variation of the
level of the ground near <span class='it'>h</span> of but a few inches does not materially
change this level. Between <span class='it'>m</span> and <span class='it'>n</span>, however, the original
soil lies one foot and seven inches lower for a distance of thirty-five
feet, and from <span class='it'>n</span> to <span class='it'>o</span> the level drops a foot lower. The
mound was originally founded upon a site rising two feet above
the adjacent ground on its western side. A gravel stratum of
8 inches in thickness near <span class='it'>o</span>, and of 4 inches near <span class='it'>p</span>, but disappearing
towards <span class='it'>n</span>, covered the clay which originally sloped to
the west. This gravel stratum was examined by Professor Lawson
and considered to be probably a fresh-water deposit and not
a deposit formed in the bay, as the gravel is more or less angular
instead of much water-worn. The mound terminates near <span class='it'>p</span>, 177
feet from its center, where it runs to a point between layers of
clay, which are above and below it (<a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>, fig. 1). It rises again
toward the outside for the last 17 feet measured from the depression
<span class='it'>n</span>, the difference being one and one-quarter feet, thus varying
from the rest of the base which inclines to the west. A stratum
of ferruginous clay, the same as that underlying the base of the
mound, is here inserted between the gravel stratum and the characteristic
mixture of which the mound is composed, and covers it
up even with the present surface of the soil. This raises the
actual height of the shellmound from 27 feet to 32 feet and the
actual diameter to at least 310 feet instead of 270 feet. The
volume of the mound, measured as a truncated cone, may be estimated
as being 55,000 cubic yards, or about 39,000 cubic meters.<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>From what we know of the situation it is obvious that the
mound was rounded upon firm though still somewhat marshy
land, near the bay shore and close to the creek. The latter was
the occasion of its location<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a> at this place. The ground must have
been dry, since a gently rising slope was selected. The soil was
alluvial and relatively new, since it has no overlying cover of
good earth, yet it must have been dry long enough to allow a thin
growth of vegetation to cover it, causing the slight gray discoloration
of this stratum.</p>

<p>The situation of the base of the mound two feet below the
water level cannot be explained on the assumption that refuse
from a pile dwelling had been the first cause of its formation.
This theory would presuppose modes of living to be followed by
the Indians of this coast for which there is no parallel elsewhere,
and which are not borne out by other evidence obtained in the
study of the mound. If the mound has not risen from the water,
then the former land surface must have sunk. The mound could
not possibly have sunk below the water level from its own weight,
for the original ground underneath it is still several feet higher
than that to the west, for instance, near <span class='it'>n</span>, and sections of the base
upon which the full weight of the mound rested, such as near <span class='it'>h</span>,
are on the same level with others over which the mound rose only
14 feet. Since the sinking of the mound has not been brought
about by local causes, it must have been caused by a general subsidence
of this coast region. Similar subsidences of the coast, due
probably to sliding motions, are frequent phenomena on alluvial
coasts.<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a> Evidences of this are furnished apparently by the
shores of San Francisco Bay.<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a> The ground under the mound
having a slope of two feet, it may be assumed that the original
foundation of the base was at least one foot above tide level.
Accordingly the coast must have sunk three feet since the formation
of this mound.<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a> This sinkage was leveled up again to
its former height by later alluvial deposits, in consequence of
which the originally dry base of the mound is now situated two
feet below the level of the bay, while the surrounding flats are
three feet above it.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the younger alluvial deposit, near <span class='it'>o</span>
(<a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>) has a thickness of six feet.</p>

<p>Samples of soil taken from various parts of the clay stratum
underlying the base of the mound were subjected by Professor
W. A. Setchell to microscopical examinations, but no Diatoms
were found in any of them. Hence those strata were probably
formed of alluvial deposits of the creek, as Professor Lawson had
at first suggested, and not of deposits of the bay. This finding is
entirely in accordance with the origin of the gravel stratum as
above stated.</p>

<p>The slope of the mound was an obstacle to the course of the
creek when it became swollen. In the natural course of things it
deposited a bar near the foot of the mound, which, when the edge
of the latter gradually extended, grew out over this new obstacle.
The creek in the same manner continued to heap up alluvial deposits
against the latter. The horizontal growth of the mound
and the vertical growth of the surrounding land took place simultaneously.
This was the cause of the brim-like upward curve of
the edge of the mound as seen in the cross section (<a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>). While
the mound increased about seventeen feet in its periphery, the
vertical alluvial accumulation was about one and one-half feet.
Hence the base of the mound peripherally increased one foot
while the ground grew one inch, showing that the alluvial growth
of the soil was much slower than the peripheral growth of the
mound. About 310 cubic yards or 240 cubic meters produce a
growth of one foot in a mound 9 feet high and about 300 feet in
diameter at the base. If the peripheral growth of the mound had
continued with the growth of the soil, the foot of the mound
would have spread out so that the outer edge would rest in the
highest or surface layer of the present alluvium. The wedge-like
margin situated between alluvial strata is, however, proof
that its peripheral growth ceased a long time before the termination
of the alluvial accumulation in this region, as a result of
which the alluvium has spread itself over the foot of the mound.
The alluvial deposit above the wedged-in margin of the mound
(at <span class='it'>p</span>) being 3 feet 8 inches in thickness, and the alluvium deposited
underneath it from the beginning of the formation of the
mound measuring only 1-1/2 feet, and assuming the increase to
have been absolutely uniform, a period two and a half times as
long has passed since the ceasing of its peripheral growth, as
had been necessary for a peripheral growth of 17 feet on each
side. The cessation of this peripheral growth of the mound, however,
is not identical with the cessation of its growth altogether.
It took place apparently when the mound began to grow more
acutely conical in shape, whereby it increased to twice its former
volume. Assuming that the mound was abandoned 100 years before
the end of the alluvial growth of the land in the vicinity,
then according to formula</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>100 × 2/3<span class='it'>f</span> = 2-1/2 × 1/3<span class='it'>f</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>it might be concluded that the mound was probably 600 years
old before it was abandoned.<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a> Several numerical values upon
which the formula is based are unfortunately so uncertain that
the result may not be considered as more than suggestive of the
possible age.</p>

<p>The sinking of the coast and the alluvial increase of the
ground since the first settlement of the mussel-eaters would in
themselves give an adequate measure for an estimate of the age
of the mound if the measures upon which both depend were not
also unknown; according to Professor Lawson, this probably occupied
centuries at least.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a> At any rate, such observations as have
been made furnish good reasons for believing that the founding
of a settlement and the beginning of the heaping up of the mound
occurred at a remote date.</p>

The shellmounds in the vicinity of the bay differ considerably in shape
and size. The majority appear as extended plateaus 10 to 12 feet in height,
others appear as slight undulations of the ground about five feet in height.
The truncated conical form is found more rarely; the mound at Ellis Landing
near Point Richmond approaches it somewhat in its proportions. Many
of these mounds cover acres of ground, <span class='it'>e.g.</span>, the mounds of Alameda, of
Sausalito, of Sierra Point, of West Berkeley (in its older form, now much
changed). In tropical regions many shellmounds are said to reach a height
of 100 feet or more; this is known with certainty of some in Brazil (cf. Nadaillac,
<span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 54), and also of two near the dried-up mouth of the Ica river
in Peru. Shellmounds as a rule are much smaller. On the Atlantic coast
near Smyrna a shellmound is said to be thirty feet high (Short, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 107),
but the majority of these mounds are less than four feet high (cf. Wyman,
Amer. Naturalist, 1868, I, p. 56 ff., and Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 440), while many of
them extend over areas of more than two or three acres. A shellmound near
the mouth of the Altamaha river in Florida is estimated as having a size of
over 80,000 cubic yards (Smithson. Rep., 1866, p. 358). The shellmounds of
Denmark are only from 3 feet to 10 feet high, although more than a thousand
feet long (Ranke, Der Mensch, II, p. 552). Southern California shellmounds
generally are from 4 feet to 5 feet high (P. Schumacher, Bull., <span class='it'>l. c.</span>,
p. 38; and Smithson. Rep., 1874, p. 337, etc.). The same is the case with
those mounds on the Aleutian Islands explored by W. J. Dall. In Oregon
there are some of at least 8 feet in height (cf. Schumacher, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 29).</p>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f13'><a href='#r13'>[13]</a></span>

Shellmounds in the bay region are mostly in localities where there is
fresh water, a creek or a spring, generally the former. W. H. Dall (Contributions,
p. 34) observes that for the formation of shellmounds on the Aleutian
Islands two conditions are necessary, as a rule: running water or a
spring, and a site suitable for boat landing; one or the other of these conditions
lacking, no shellmounds are to be found. In Oregon the shellmounds
are generally to be found near a creek (cf. Schumacher, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 28). The
same rule probably governs the shellmounds of the East. D. G. Brinton
found shellmounds in Florida generally near running water (Smithson. Rep.,
1866, p. 356), but he supposes as the cause of this the greater abundance of
shells near the mouths of rivers, while it is certain that the presence of drinking
water was the main attraction.</p>

Parts of the eastern coast of the United States are sinking. Several
shellmounds on the Jersey coast are being washed away at present (cf. Abbott,
<span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 448 ff.). The same may be observed with the shellmounds near
Ellis Landing on the Bay of San Francisco.</p>

Between the shellmounds of Emeryville and West Berkeley the shore
for a long stretch forms a steep bank up to twelve feet high, and broken
down by the water of the bay. Possibly the coast at this point formed a promontory
on the two sides of which these shellmounds were originally founded,
as in sheltered bays, similar to other mounds of this region.</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f17'><a href='#r17'>[17]</a></span>

In that case the sinkage would have amounted to about 6 inches, the
alluvial increase to about 9 to 10 inches in a century.</p>

The rapidity of the sinkage of alluvial coasts varies greatly owing to
local conditions. For the Atlantic Coast the rate of sinkage is 2 feet per
century (cf. Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 449). Applying this same rate to the eastern
coast of the Bay, we would arrive at the absurd result that the shellmound of
Emeryville had begun to form in 1750, while that date was presumably the
end of its occupied state.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span><span class='sc'>The Internal Structure of the Mound.</span></h2>

<p>The principal constituents of the mound are the shells. These
have nearly all crumbled into small fragments and are slightly
mixed with soil, which when damp gives the entire mass the appearance
of pure soil. When this is flooded with water the washing
away of the sand produces no noticeable change in its volume.
This mass has mingled with it bits of charcoal, bones of animals,
ashes or cinders, and stones averaging about the size of one’s fist
and blackened by fire.<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a> Marks of stratification may be traced
through almost the entire mound. <a href='#pl5'>Plate 5</a>, representing a photographic
view of the excavation, shows the stratification planes in
the walls quite distinctly. The strata consist of compact masses
of more or less fragmentary shells, or of beds of ashes or cinders.
In many cases the latter seem to extend through the entire mound.
They are sometimes not thicker than a sheet of heavy paper, but
show the general direction of the bedding planes, and form a
clear contrast with the homogeneous, dark mass of broken shells.<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a>
These planes become somewhat less distinct in the deeper strata.<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a>
As in other shellmounds,<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> there were observed certain rounded
masses of shells intersecting the lines of stratification. These are
caused by holes, made by moles or other burrowing animals, being
afterward refilled with shells.<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>In some shellmounds in other regions strata of earth and sand
were found between the shell layers. These give evidence of a
temporary evacuation of the shellmound. No evidence of this
character was obtained in the study of the Emeryville mound,
where the only occurrence of a natural vegetable soil is the surface
cover of 1 to 2 inches in thickness, which has formed since
the mound was finally abandoned.<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a> It is possible that slight
differences in the state of preservation of the shell deposits which
now mark the strata lines may have been caused by differences in
the length of time of occupation. Other explanations might, however,
be offered.</p>

<p>The lines of stratification mark clearly the gradual development
of the strata of the mound from the base until the present
truncated cone was formed. It is apparent that two different
principles governed the growth of the mound. At certain periods
it tended to take on a shallow plateau form. At other times
a conical shape developed without the corresponding increase
around the base. According to the first principle the mound
grew in the form of a plateau to a height of from 9 to 10 feet.
Near <span class='it'>C</span> in <a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a> the edge of the plateau still seems to be traceable,
from which point the strata inclined downward. At that period
the mound resembled in its proportions the old Indian camping
places of the interior valley, some of which are still occupied; or
some of the shellmounds along the Bay which have been abandoned
at some earlier period. The undulating lines of the strata,
such as seen near <span class='it'>f</span> and <span class='it'>g</span>, suggest irregularities of the old plateau
surface, similar to those which may be observed in the
surfaces of camp locations of the interior, which have been abandoned
for decades. The hollows from 20 to 40 feet in length
mark the sites of former sweat-houses or council-halls; these
curves, such as that from <span class='it'>f</span> to <span class='it'>g</span>, may have a similar origin.<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The manner in which the mound was occupied for habitation
varied in the upper strata. With the growth of the mound the
diameter of the plateau decreased instead of expanding. From
line <span class='it'>b</span> upward the strata incline obliquely toward the sides. This
change in the manner of forming the mound signifies a change
in the character of its occupants. It would be interesting to determine,
if possible, the exact line where these two types of
growth have met. It might have been about 12 feet above the
base, so that the mound grew in the shape of a shallow plateau
as far as the middle of stratum V in <a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>, and that it changed
after this period to its conical form.</p>

The descriptions of nearly all the shellmounds explored in other parts
of the world tally exactly with this one; cf. Ranke, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, II, p. 532, for the

Although no shellmound is free from stratification marks, owing to the

Similar holes made by moles may be observed occasionally upon old
shellmounds along the Bay, which if they had been refilled with shells might
also have assumed a rounded form. In such a manner may be explained the
finding of a modern steel knife, with the wooden parts still well preserved,
in one of the strata of the shellmound of West Berkeley in a place to all appearances
undisturbed.</p>

of the mound is proof that at no time was the mound abandoned by its

<h2><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span><span class='sc'>Constituents of the Mound.</span></h2>

<p><span class='it'>Shells.</span>—The shell layers of the mound are composed principally
of the following species:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Oysters, <span class='it'>Ostrea lurida</span>.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Mussel shells, <span class='it'>Mytilus edulis</span> and <span class='it'>Mytilus californianus</span>.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Clams, <span class='it'>Macoma edulis</span> and <span class='it'>Macoma nasuta</span>.</p>

<p>Many other kinds of shells, including the following species,
were found scattered through the mound:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Purpura crispata</span> and <span class='it'>canaliculata</span>.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Cerithidea californica.</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Helix</span>, two species indet.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Cardium corbis.</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Standella</span>, sp.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'><span class='it'>Tapes staminea.</span></p>

<p>Of these last species, the cockle, <span class='it'>Cardium corbis</span>, and the clam,
<span class='it'>Tapes staminea</span>, occur quite frequently.<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a> All of these were used
as food by the occupants of the mound. The various species of
<span class='it'>Helix</span> were probably also used, as they were in more recent times
eaten by the California Indians.<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a> It may be, however, that this
species lived on the mound.</p>

<p>The state of preservation of the shells is proportional to their
natural hardness. Hence the shells of the Macomas are the most
conspicuous, those of the mussels, as the most perishable, are the
least noticeable ones in the mound. The relative frequency of
occurrence in the case of the three most important species depends
on different circumstances.</p>

<p>The lower and the upper strata of this mound are composed
of the same varieties of shells, in which point it is different from
many shellmounds in other regions. It is, however, true that
oyster shells predominate in the lower strata, while <span class='it'>Macoma</span> shells
are more numerous in the upper ones.<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Visiting the different shellmounds in the vicinity of the Bay,
one finds a general similarity in the kinds of shells composing
them. Rarely one or another variety of shell, the <span class='it'>Macoma</span> or the
cockle, or some other, is found to predominate. This general
homogeneity of composition in the shellmounds around the Bay,
and the small differences in the amount of any particular species,
indicates as a whole the general similarity of the shell fauna at
many points about the Bay during the period of occupation of
the mounds.</p>

<p>The Indian camping grounds in the interior, although quite
similar in form and origin to the shellmounds on the coast, when
opened generally present a great difference in appearance.
Traces of shells are almost unnoticed from the outside, yet large
quantities supplied as food by the rivers of the interior are doubtless
to be found in them. These shells have been found during
excavations, or their use has been confirmed by persons who observed
the mode of living of the Indians of these regions. The
Indians also obtained salt-water mussels by trade, even in quite
recent times. From the fact that shells are not in evidence on
the surface of the camp grounds, one must conclude that their
use diminished.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
<span class='it'>Bones.</span>—Bones of vertebrates are also found in most of the
shellmounds. These together with the shells represent the debris
of their kitchens. No other shellmound has been seen where so
large a quantity of bones was observed as in that at Emeryville.
Bones of land and sea mammals, of birds, and of fishes were
found in abundance throughout the mound, and fairly evenly
distributed in the strata. This fact is the more remarkable since
the shellmound at West Berkeley, scarcely two miles distant,
does not yield nearly such quantities of bone as this one. The
occupants of the mound at Emeryville at all periods were huntsmen
to a great degree, besides being fishermen; those of the
mound at West Berkeley seem to have depended largely upon
fishing; hence the stone sinkers were far more numerous in that
mound than at Emeryville.</p>

the base have been studied. The following species obtained in

<p>No traces of cannibalism have been detected. Most of the
hollow bones of larger mammals, and even the smaller bones of
the foot, were found to have been split to get at the marrow.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
<span class='it'>Fireplaces.</span>—These were generally known by beds several feet
in length consisting of charcoal and yellowish ashes. They occurred
in many spots throughout the mound. Numberless scattered
bits of charcoal<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a> and pebbles, mostly about the size of one’s
fist and blackened by fire, were further evidences of the continuous
use of fire in the preparation of food. In no instance were
there any stones set in rows for fireplaces, such as have been observed
elsewhere, as in a shellmound near Sierra Point, where
stones are plentiful.<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a> A very peculiar feature of this mound is a
yellowish layer of ashes comprising the entire depth of stratum
II in <a id='IV2'></a><a href='#pl4'>pl. IV</a>, and tapering towards the edge of the mound. Above
it lies only the uppermost stratum (I), that of vegetable soil.
Though calcined shells<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a> occurred elsewhere in the mound, they
were especially numerous in this ash stratum, and in some spots
all shells were calcined. The origin of this ash stratum will be
explained later. A similar bed is to be seen in a central layer of
the shellmound at West Berkeley, and another one of similar
thickness but shorter in a mound near Sausalito.</p>

<p><a id='human'></a>
<span class='it'>Human Remains and Relics.</span>—A large part of the Emeryville
mound consists of remains which have been deposited here by
man. Among these are molluscan shells with bones of fish and
mammals, used as articles of food. In the narrower sense the
human relics consist of the bones of man, graves, and artifacts,
which are all found in greater or less abundance throughout the
whole thickness of the mound. Actual human bones were not
found to be common in this part of the mound except in stratum
II, and in the graves of stratum VII. The artifacts obtained
were only those of very resistant material, such as stone or shell.
All other kinds, such as textiles of plant fibre, baskets, and implements
of wood, which doubtless have also existed, had disappeared.
The more resistant artifacts were distributed throughout
all layers of the mound.<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>About 200 cubic meters of earth were removed and sifted
during the excavations, and yielded 600 artifacts of various
kinds, averaging three specimens to one cubic meter. The volume
of the whole mound we computed to be about 39,000 cubic
meters, and it may be assumed that by excavating the entire
mound the yield would be about 100,000 specimens, which indicates
that many generations must have lived here to deposit such
a large number of objects of imperishable material alone.<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The same computation was applied to each separate layer in
the mound, and it was shown that the yield differed according to
the section and the stratum explored. The open cut <span class='it'>A</span> yielded
one specimen to .75 cb. m., and the tunnel <span class='it'>B</span> and the pits <span class='it'>h</span> to <span class='it'>m</span>,
six per cb. m. Section <span class='it'>C</span> yielded three artifacts to one cb. m.
This computation shows that sections nearer the center of the
mound yielded the greater number, those toward the edge a
smaller number. It also appears that the lower strata contained
a larger percentage of artifacts than the upper ones. If, however,
the number of flaked chert fragments were subtracted from
the yield of the lower strata, their percentage would be much the
same as that of the higher layers. The following are the contents
of the various strata:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum I had 20 artifacts per 15-1/2 cb. m. = 1.3 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum II, 30 cb. m—133 objects = 4.4 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum III, 20-2/3 cb. m—27 objects = 1.16 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum IV, 11-3/4 cb. m.—41 objects = 3.5 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum V, 9-2/3 cb. m.—34 objects = 3.5 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum VI, 4-1/5 cb. m.—9 objects = 2.1 per cb. m.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>Stratum VII, 2-4/5 cb. m.—10 objects = 3.5 per cb. m.</p>

<p>The specimens contained in the graves in strata VI and VII
were not counted in with the rest. This comparison shows mainly
that stratum II is the richest in implements. The connection of
this fact with the preponderance of ashes will be pointed out
later.</p>

We were not so fortunate as was W. H. Dall in the shellmounds of the
Aleutian Islands in being able to make “a tolerably uniform division” of
the layers in the mound according to the various foods used. (These layers
were: “1, Echinus layer; 2, fishbone layer; 3, hunting layer.” Contributions
to North American Ethnology, I, p. 49.) The shellmound of Emeryville
presents a much greater similarity in the kinds of food used during the
different periods of its occupancy.</p>

It is alleged that there are shellmounds in the East which contain no
implements at all, and have been used for the gathering of mussels only, and
not as dwelling places (Abbott, p. 447, accord. to Charles A. Woodley).
Equally uncertain seems to be the distinction made by Schumacher between
shellmounds yielding few artifacts and those containing a larger number, as
representing a place for temporary or permanent habitation. Similarly dubious
is that classification which considers the piling up of shells in various
separate heaps as proof of permanent abode and that of single mounds for
the use only as temporary stopping places (Smithson. Rep., 1874, pp. 337 to
338).</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span><span class='sc'>Burials.</span></h2>

<p>Shellmounds originate on the accumulated refuse deposited
by people who have lived in the place when the heap has formed,
and the mounds may therefore be regarded as sites for dwelling
places, or abodes for the living, and not as mounds set aside as
burial grounds by people living elsewhere in the vicinity. Whenever
these mounds were used for burials it was not done in spite
of their being dwelling places, but rather because they were
such.<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Many tribes of a low grade of civilization follow the custom
of burying their dead underneath their feet in the ground upon
which they live, to protect the graves of their dead against being
disturbed and also to enjoy the protection of the spirits of the
departed against their enemies. Wherever graves are found in
shellmounds, in all parts of the world, their presence is generally
to be explained in this way.<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Ten graves containing skeletons were found during the excavations.
They were found only in the middle layers of the mound
in a zone extending from stratum VI to stratum VIII. The two
lowest layers and the five upper ones contained no evidence of
interment, indicating that the custom of burial underneath the
dwelling places was observed in one period only. We have no
evidence concerning the location of the burials previous to that
period or subsequent to it. A burial site slightly elevated above
the plain was unearthed some years ago under a shellmound near
the principal mound in Emeryville, but as this probably dated
from the same period as the graves in the shellmound no light is
thrown upon the question.</p>

<p>In the upper strata of the mound there is, however, furnished
evidence of a different manner of disposing of the dead, which
was observed during the period of the deposition of strata II, III,
and IV. During the period represented by strata VI to VIII the
dead were buried in the ground. It has already been shown that
stratum II consists mainly of ashes and calcined shells, which
cannot be regarded as kitchen-midden deposit or as the remains
of fireplaces, the latter forming an inconspicuous part of the
stratum. Another characteristic feature of this layer is the high
percentage of calcined bone implements found there. Very common
among them are awls, of which stratum II contained 44
calcined specimens, or 72 per cent. of the whole number. In the
other layers a much smaller number has been found, but the percentage
of calcined specimens is high. The supposition that these
were accidentally burned cannot be considered an adequate explanation,
but the fact that a number of human bones were found
at the same place in the strata gives weight to the theory that
during the deposition of the upper beds the inhabitants of this
region practiced cremation of their dead, a custom common
among the California tribes of today. Then as now they were
accustomed to burn all personal belongings with the body.<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a> This
accounts for the large number of calcined bone objects and shells
in stratum II. Doubtless a large number of shell-fish were
thrown into the fire as food for the departed on their long journey
into the next world.</p>

<p>Doubtless the practice of cremation was not confined alone to
the period of stratum II. The percentage of calcined awls in
other strata than this suggests that the builders during the accumulation
of stratum I, and probably also of III and IV and
parts of V, practiced this custom, but to a less extent than in the
period of stratum II, or mainly at other places than the mound.</p>

<p>Eight of the ten graves containing skeletons lay close together
in the narrow space of the middle section of the excavation. Four
were found in strata VI and VII of the upper cut <span class='it'>C</span>. Four of the
graves were those of children, lying at different depths in the
line of the tunnel. Two other graves were isolated from the
others, lying in the edge of the mound. None of the burials were
less than nine feet below the present surface. The lowest grave,
No. 10 (<a id='IV'></a><a href='#pl4'>pl. IV, fig. 2</a>), was 21 feet below the surface. In accordance
with the stratification lines of the mound, graves 1 and 2,
as well as 6, 8, and 9, may be considered as belonging to the period
of strata VII and VII<span class='it'>a</span>. The eight graves which lay close
together in the middle of the main excavation were distributed
over a space of about 90 square feet. The vertical distance from
the uppermost to the lowest of these was nine feet. As the tunnel
inclines toward the center of the mound it is not certain whether
the cemetery extended through the entire mound or was only
around the margin of a settlement on the summit of the mound
at the time when it was in use. From the depths at which the
different graves were found, varying about nine feet, it is clear
that they were not constructed within a short period, but that
long periods intervened, during which the mound grew very considerably
through the deposition of refuse. P. Schumacher explored
the graves of Oregon, which lay at a depth of from 1-1/2
to 2-1/2 feet below the surface, and probably the tribes of the Pacific
Coast buried their dead in comparatively shallow graves.<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a>
In the case of a child’s grave (No. 9, <a href='#pl4'>pl. 4</a>, fig. 2) it was seen
by the stratification lines that it was not made deeper than 1-1/2
feet below the surface. Assuming this as being the general depth
of the graves throughout the mound, then the graves varying between
2-1/2 and 12-1/2 feet above the base of the mound were dug
at periods when the entire height of the mound was about 5 to 14
feet, hence the period of these burials would have to be placed
entirely during the time of the earlier plateau-like growth of the
mound. This period of burial is very closely followed by that of
cremation, the two possibly overlapping.</p>

<p>The preparation of the graves was not elaborate. A simple
pit sufficed. It was made large enough to place the body in it
with the knees drawn up. The sides of the grave were left bare.
If a covering existed originally it must have been of perishable
materials, for none have been found in excavation. The bottom
of the grave, however, was prepared somewhat like a bed. A
layer of charcoal from one-half inch to one inch thick is found at
the very bottom, above that another layer of like thickness of iron
oxide. Upon this the body was laid on its side. It is evident that
the body was buried with its clothing and personal ornaments, in
exceptional cases with utensils or implements only. The body
was tightly bound at the knees before burial. Owing to climatic
conditions, causing excessive moisture in the strata, the greater
part of the material buried with the corpse has decayed and disappeared.
Five of the ten graves were entirely lacking in implements
or other artifacts.</p>

<p>Before burial the body was entirely covered with the red earth
mentioned above. This settled down upon the bones after decomposition
and is still adhering to them in some cases like a thick
crust. The hands were placed on the body in different ways. In
several instances the left hand rested upon the knees, while the
other was raised to the mouth or to the crown of the head. The
corpse is usually laid upon the right side, generally facing northeast.
Associated with a number of skeletons were a variety of
interesting ornaments, including beads made from shells of <span class='it'>Olivella</span>
and other molluscs and from sections of bird bones strung
together. With skeleton No. 4 were associated a large number of
perforated mica flakes. The flakes of mica may originally have
been fastened to a garment which shrouded the dead, and when
this decayed in the earth the flakes remained there about the
body. Beads of bird bone were found in the mouth also, but
their presence there might be explained by the settling of the
skull in the earth. Mica was much used by the Indians for ornamentation.
It has been observed in Peru in a number of cases in
the vicinity of graves, but circumstances did not show whether
its presence there was purely accidental or not. In the mounds
of the middle west of the United States there have sometimes
been found ornaments of thin plates of mica of round or oval
form, provided with holes to fasten them to the clothing.<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a> Similar
objects were found in West Virginia and elsewhere. Pieces
of mica 2 or 3 inches in size are reported to have been found in
mounds or in places suggestive of their use for religious purposes.<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a>
Beads like the above mentioned from California, both
from graves and from living Indians, were pictured by Holmes.<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a>
With burial six was a bone ring set with shell beads fastened on
with asphalt. In burial seven were numerous bone rings similarly
decorated with shell beads. Also in burial seven was found
a large quartz crystal. One end of the crystal is preserved unbroken.
The other end is capped with asphaltum in which numerous
small shell beads are set. Quartz crystals have been found
elsewhere in California in graves.<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a> The above mentioned crystal,
however, reminds us most strongly of a number of crystals one
foot in length and of the thickness of one’s arm, found during
the excavation of the western wall of the Temple of the Moon at
Moche (Trujillo), in Peru, now in the collection of the University
of California. These, too, had the coating of red coloring earth,
the same as the object shown on <a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 9, and were found
under peculiar conditions pointing strongly to their religious
significance.</p>

<p>Several peculiar bone implements were obtained in burial
eight.</p>

<p>The mode of burial seen here resembles that observed elsewhere
in the shellmounds of California, for example, near San
Luis Obispo, and that of other regions on the Pacific Coast (Oregon),
and it is still followed among the California Indian tribes.
The burial of the corpse with its knees drawn up has also been
observed in Southern California<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a> and Oregon.<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a> From the latter
region also the varying positions in which the corpses face is
confirmed by Schumacher.<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>To the layer of charcoal and red iron oxide which generally
formed the bed of the dead may be compared the “thick burned
brick-like crusts” and the “thin light colored crusts” found by
Schumacher in Southern California graves.<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[48]</span></sup></a> A large number
of lumps of red coloring earth were found throughout the mound,
some of these showing marks of scraping or cutting. In Southern
California graves we find conditions resembling these almost identically.<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[49]</span></sup></a>
Up to recent times the California Indians very generally
painted their bodies, and there is undoubtedly a religious
significance in this practice of daubing the corpses and associated
objects with red coloring material, besides depositing them on red
earth. The custom of putting red coloring matter on the body of
the dead is found with many aboriginal tribes. So the Caribs in
Jamaica<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[50]</span></sup></a> paint the entire body of the corpse. The Santees of
South Carolina<a id='r51'/><a href='#f51' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[51]</span></sup></a> painted face, neck, and hands of the corpse.
The Dakotas<a id='r52'/><a href='#f52' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[52]</span></sup></a> painted the face alone. In a number of Peruvian
mummies the faces were painted red. Crania from ancient Peruvian
graves that had been disturbed at some early time were
also found covered with red paint.</p>

<p>The absence of implements is explained by Schumacher by
the analogous custom of the lower Klamath tribes, where the implements
are laid upon the grave instead of being buried with the
dead.<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[53]</span></sup></a> This custom may have prevailed in this shellmound.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate circumstance that the exploration in
Emeryville occurred at a season of the year when the interior of
the mound was still very damp from preceding rains. For this
reason none of the skulls could be secured intact, and they will
need to be carefully prepared before use can be made of them for
anthropological study. It may be noted that none of them show
striking eccentricities of form.</p>

<p>Following is a detailed statement of the occurrence and the
contents of each of the ten burials excavated.</p>

<p>No. 1, <a href='#pl4'>pl. IV</a>, fig. 2, was found 9 feet below the present surface;
it may be contemporaneous with the graves of stratum VII
(as 6 and 9). The skeleton was that of an adult, drawn up in the
usual manner. It was laid on its right side and was facing east.
The left arm rested upon the knee, the right hand on the crown
of the head, where also was found a cockleshell. The skeleton
lay on a bed of red soil; the bones were slightly reddened. No
associated objects.</p>

<p>No. 2. Skeleton of an adult, found at a depth of 9 feet in
the outer part (A) of the excavation; neither red earth nor associated
objects present. The burial dated probably from the same
period as the preceding.</p>

<p>No. 3. Grave of a young person, about 15 years of age, in
stratum VI. The skeleton was facing northwest. No artifacts or
other associated objects.</p>

<p><a id='grave'></a>No. 4. Grave of an adult, in stratum VI. The skeleton lay
from east to west upon a double bed of charcoal and red earth.
Interspersed in the soil were found a great quantity of flakes of
mica 1 to 1-3/4 inches in diameter, rhomboidal, triangular, and
irregular in shape, and each with a hole at one end (see <a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>,
fig. 18); also a quantity of beads made of bird bones were found
upon the cranium as if they had formed part of a net drawn over
it; others lay along the sides of the head and along the temples.</p>

<p>No. 5. Skeleton of an adult lying from east to west and
facing north. Stratum VI. The cranium shows a lupus-like mutilation
of the nose (fig. 2). No ornaments.</p>

tunnel in stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, at a depth of 17 feet below the surface.
It lay from north to south upon a bed of charcoal and red earth.
Various ornaments and other articles were taken from this grave,
all covered with red earth. A number of shell beads, both flat
(cf. <a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, figs. 6<span class='it'>a</span> and 6<span class='it'>b</span>), and concave forms (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, figs. 5<span class='it'>a</span>
and 5<span class='it'>b</span>) lay in rows from the neck down along the body, and were
originally necklaces; two bored round pieces and two oblong ones
(pl. 11, figs. 1 and 2) of <span class='it'>Haliotis</span> shell had completed the necklace.
An unusual object (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 8) found here was a flat ring
three-eighths of an inch wide, three-sixteenths of an inch thick,
neatly made of stone, both surfaces being decorated with a number
of shell beads, originally 11 to 12 on each side, fastened with
asphaltum. This object may have been a pendant, but doubtless
it possessed talismanic virtues.</p>

<p>Shell beads like the larger convex ones of <span class='it'>Olivella</span> sp. have
been pictured by Holmes as objects belonging to early and modern
Indians of California. Possibly they also resemble the shell
coin “Kolkol” of the modern Indians, which is made of <span class='it'>Olivella
biplicata</span>, according to Powers, and was strung in such a manner
that the beads faced each other in pairs, but are not much in use
in modern times.</p>

<p>A shell ring of similar proportions as above, but differing
through its inferior material and the absence of decoration, has
also been pictured by Holmes as coming from Illinois, and as
being an ear ornament presumably, while the object described
above could not have served that purpose.</p>

<p>No. 7. Grave of a child about one year old, found in stratum
VIII, about 21 feet below the surface of the mound. The
body lay upon the usual bed of charcoal and of red earth and all
the little bones were thickly covered with red coloring matter.
The grave was as rich in artifacts as the preceding one. A number
of small shell beads (as in <a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 6) were found near the
wrist. The following objects were taken from the earth about
the body:</p>

<p>Three oblong ornaments, bored, of <span class='it'>Haliotis</span> shell (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig.
1), a number of very small shells of <span class='it'>Olivella</span> sp. having bored
ends, which fact shows that they were used as ornaments; 11
bead-like rings of bone, each being about one inch long and seven-sixteenths
of an inch thick; each has a band of asphaltum in which
three or four small shells were imbedded (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, figs. 10, 11).
While these rings may have been mere ornaments, the following
unusual object (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 9) taken from the same grave must
without doubt have talismanic importance. It is a piece of quartz
crystal 2-15/16 inches long and 1-1/2 inches thick, having perfect
lateral edges and points; the broken base of the crystal is capped
with asphaltum in which numerous small shell beads are set.</p>

<p>All these objects were thickly coated with red coloring matter.
For the small ornamental <span class='it'>Olivella</span> shells compare similar ones
from Santa Rosa Island, California, pictured by Holmes (l. c.,
fig. 7). The bone ring resembles the thick bead-like bone ring
taken from another of the graves, stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, of the mound.</p>

<p>No. 8. Burial of an adult, in stratum VII, found above the
tunnel. The body in the usual squatting position was placed
from north to south, facing east, upon a bed of red earth and was
itself colored red. This grave contained besides objects of personal
adornment a number of bone implements. The former consisted
of a number of beads made of bird bone (types similar to
object <a href='#pl10'>pl. 11</a>, figs. 15 to 17) and a like number of <span class='it'>Olivella</span> shells
bored at the lower end (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 3); they were scattered in the
earth about the body. One of the <span class='it'>Olivella</span> shells was perforated
on its side (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 4). Several of the bone beads were connected
in twos by thinner bones (<a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, fig. 15). It may be
assumed that the bone beads and shells had been fastened to a
garment that served as a shroud for the body but has now disappeared.</p>

<p>The bone implements taken from this grave have the shape of
paper cutters; there are five in all, representing two distinct
types. Three are made of a hard bone (<a href='#pl8'>pl. 8</a>, fig. 4) and are imperfect
at their upper ends; the form is that of a horn, the worn
edges show their use as tools; the other two objects (<a href='#pl8'>pl. 8</a>, fig. 5)
are made of a much softer bone; they are unfinished at their
lower ends. The two types are distinct, although it is difficult
to compare them in their very imperfect condition. The upper
end of the implement of the second type shows two hooked projections
connected by an outward bending of their rims. They
have each a hole on the lower edge of such a size as to admit a
finger, to facilitate the handling of the tool. Neither of these
types was met in other parts of the mound.</p>

<p>An <span class='it'>Olivella</span> shell with side perforation similar to that of <a href='#pl11'>plate 11</a>,
fig. 4, from a grave on Santa Rosa Island has been represented
by Holmes<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[54]</span></sup></a>. Bone beads similar to that of figs. 16 and 17 on
<a href='#pl11'>plate 11</a> were found in nearly all the strata of the mound; two
of these are shown in figs. 13 and 14 of the same plate, the former,
1-8702, from stratum IV, the latter, 1-8743, from stratum V.
It also has a remnant of a former axle-like connection with another
bead as was shown in fig. 15 from stratum V. Bone beads
have been widely used as objects of adornment by the California
Indians, as is the case with many tribes in other parts of the
world<a id='r55'/><a href='#f55' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[55]</span></sup></a>. With the Yokuts bird bone pieces of 2-1/2 inches in
length at one time represented a value of 12-1/2 cents.</p>

<p>No. 9. A child’s grave, in stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, in the tunnel about
18 feet below the surface. The associated objects were convex
shell beads (cf. <a href='#pl11'>pl. 11</a>, figs. 5<span class='it'>a</span> and 5<span class='it'>b</span>) and a cockleshell upon the
crown of the head (cf. grave No. 1).</p>

<p>No. 10. Grave of an infant with very delicate bones. It was
found in the lowest part of section VIII, 23 feet below the surface.</p>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span><span class='sc'>Age of the Mound.</span></h2>

<p>The shellmounds of the environs of San Francisco Bay are
almost the only witnesses of a practically unknown period in the
early history of this region.<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56]</span></sup></a> They appear to us at first investigation
unintelligible, both as regards the beginning and the end
of the period during which they served as human abodes. For a
solution of the problem before us the most diverse kinds of investigations
must be carried on, before the principal facts of this
history can be clearly brought out.</p>

<p>Shellmounds can be found along almost all parts of the inhabited
coast. In California as well as in other parts of the world
they originate by the accumulation of remnants of food, especially
the shells of the mollusca which are used as articles of diet.
In the midst of the remnants of food cast aside by him, man clung
to his place of abode, raising it more and more above the general
level of the ground through the gradual accumulation of these
materials. Hence these localities represent, in certain stages of
human development, true but nevertheless low types of human
dwelling places. The manner of procuring the essentials of life
by collecting shells in itself indicates a low form of human existence.
In all parts of the world, even today, people may be seen
on the shore at low water gathering for food the shells uncovered
by the retreating tide; and although under the changed conditions
of life they raise no shellmounds, these people always belong
to the lower classes of society, and lead in this manner a primitive
as well as a simple life. Peoples depending for food upon collecting
shells are usually not agriculturists, but fishermen, and
perhaps hunters as a secondary occupation. Their implements
are of the rudest kind, made of bone, stone, wood, and the like.
Industries of a more highly developed kind, <span class='it'>e.g.</span>, the dressing
of ore and working it up into various implements, remained unknown
to them, except in perhaps a few instances.</p>

<p>Thus it seems natural to connect the origin of shellmounds in
general with the work of prehistoric generations, <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, man of the
stone age. The only condition necessary for their origin is, that
the people who raised them lived somewhat close together and
therefore possessed a certain social organization. For only in
many centuries or even in tens of centuries could even large
groups of men pile up such enormous quantities of kitchen debris
into hills which come to form prominent features of the landscape.
Though little is definitely known, the beginnings of human
social organization evidently reached back into Quaternary
time, just as is the case with the beginnings of human ornamentation.
There is therefore no good reason why the origin of the
shellmounds could not date back to Quaternary time. In this
connection mention must be made of the fact that, according to
Cook,<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[57]</span></sup></a> stone implements of argillite, which would consequently
be attributed to the palaeolithic man, were found in a shellmound
of New Jersey. The well known shellmounds of Denmark, the
so-called “Kjoekkenmoeddings” (<span class='it'>i.e.</span>, “Kitchen debris”), which
first attracted the attention of scientists to the remnants left by
prehistoric men, are not so old.<a id='r58'/><a href='#f58' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[58]</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, it has been possible
to prove by them that Denmark had at the time of their
origin a flora considerably different from that of the present, and
that the Auerhahn, too, lived there, which does not exist in Denmark
today. J. Wyman, a very careful explorer of the shellmounds
of New England, does not consider the Atlantic shellmounds
of this continent as old as those of Denmark.<a id='r59'/><a href='#f59' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[59]</span></sup></a> He seems
to have taken this view because he met with no authentic proofs
of a greater age. These were difficult to obtain. Yet he calls
attention to the finding of traces of the auk, the wild turkey, and
the elk in those shellmounds, <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, animals which no longer exist
in the region of shellmounds investigated by him. According to
him, their disappearance took place in historic times.</p>

<p>In determining the age of the Emeryville mound we note first
the fact that no traces of typical Quaternary animals were found
in it. It is interesting to find that this mound resembles those
just mentioned in regard to the finding of traces of the beaver,
an animal no longer met with in this region. It was found in one
of the lower strata of the mound. How far it reaches upward
cannot as yet be decided, since the large number of bones taken
from the upper beds have not all been examined. Since the time
that remains of this animal were deposited in the lower strata of
the mound, the beaver has retreated from this region, in fact
from the whole of California, in a northerly direction, possibly
up to Washington. When it left this region is not known. We
cannot, however, be certain that this retreat may not have commenced
in recent times.</p>

<p>Another fact of importance in fixing the age of this mound is
found in the apparent change of level of the strata upon which
the original layers of the mound were placed. As nearly as can
be determined, the original fundament upon which the mound
stands has sunk at least three feet. The base of the mound, formerly
probably one foot above the usual high water level<a id='r60'/><a href='#f60' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[60]</span></sup></a> of the
bay, lies at present two feet below. If the mound with its environs
had not since grown above the level of the original floor, it
would be inundated completely for several hours twice a day.
The length of time required for such a subsidence we can of
course not determine with any exactness, as no measure of subsidence
is available. In all probability it is to be taken an
indication of considerable antiquity.</p>

<p>Further facts upon which an approximation of the age of the
mound may be based are of a purely anthropological nature.
Usually the early period in which man made use solely of flaked
stone tools is contrasted with the later age when polished as well
as chipped stone implements were used. In the very lowest stratum
of the hill, almost down at the base, there were found stone
implements of the well known palaeolithic turtle-back form. A
pestle fragment which came from the lower stratum of the mound,
though having a completely disintegrated exterior, seems to have
originally been artificially rounded. A mortar fragment found
low down may have originated from an implement which was
formed, as is often the case, out of a common boulder. But before
it broke from this object the mortar was deeply worn out,
just as others that have come down to our times. Also, the deep
concavity of its rims speaks for long continued wear. The next
stratum (two to four feet above the base of the mound) yielded
the fragment of a pestle of irregular, not rounded cross section.
Here a common oblong pebble may have been used as a pestle.
Besides these, the two lower strata furnished only an oval, flattened
pebble, probably used as a hammer, the only one of its kind
in the whole mound.</p>

<p>These four stone implements represent the only specimens of
the two lowest strata of the mound which are not chipped. A
little above these the excellently polished tool 1-8925 (<a href='#pl10'>pl. 10</a>,
fig. 9) was found (in stratum VIII). This is the only one of
such workmanship before the IVth stratum upwards. Therefore
it is by no means impossible that rubbed or polished stone implements,
excepting mortars and pestles, were unknown at the time
of the origin of the lower strata, and that their use was rather
limited in the succeeding strata. But the presence of mortar
fragments and pestles in the lowest strata points toward a higher
development of the human type than is usually expected of men
who use flaked tools only.</p>

<p>It will have become evident from the foregoing remarks that
the general zoological, geological, and anthropological facts which
are available for fixing the age of the mound offer only indefinite
evidence; uncertain even for an approximate dating of the time
of the mound’s beginning. They do not preclude the possibility
of an age numbering many centuries; neither do they prove it.
Under such circumstances it seems proper to take into account
some more general considerations which appear in a study of the
shellmounds of the bay as a whole.</p>

<p>We shall probably not make too great a mistake if we estimate
the number of the larger shellmounds around the Bay of San
Francisco to be over 100. So many and such enormous shellmounds
can not possibly have been constructed by human hands
unintentionally in any small number of centuries. Furthermore,
they form a link of a larger chain of similar mounds which stretch
northerly along the coast and inland from Southern California
to beyond Vancouver and possibly still farther; <span class='it'>i.e.</span>, a distance
of 18 degrees of latitude. The extension of such a similar manner
of life over so great an area speaks of itself for the work of a
great number of centuries. Even the complete development of
this peculiar mode of existence, as represented in these mounds,
must have taken centuries. And this is the more probably true
since in those earlier stages of cultural evolution advances in the
manner of living were infinitely more difficult than they were
later. Under these circumstances it is only possible to assume
that the origin of the shellmounds in this region represents a
historical development of more than a thousand, possibly many
thousand years.<a id='r61'/><a href='#f61' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[61]</span></sup></a> If this holds good generally for the origin of
shellmounds among which the one at Emeryville is, judged by
its height, the character of its contents in the lower strata, and
the observed geological facts, by no means the youngest, we have
still to consider on the other hand the limits of the time up to
which these mounds may have been inhabited.</p>

<p>For a long time it has been customary to consider the last as
well as the first occupation of the shellmounds as belonging to the
remote past. The fact that in California no shellmound is known
which is now inhabited or has been inhabited in historic time
would speak for this assumption. However, many instances point
to habitation of the mounds in the most recent times, not only in
a few places, but in different parts of the whole inhabited world.
And this cannot surprise us; for we can see primitive man reach
into the most recent, nay, even the present time, in various parts
of the globe. Thus, as is well known, the first discoverers described
the Indians of the Gulf of Mexico as men “living in
houses of mats erected upon hills of oysters.”<a id='r62'/><a href='#f62' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[62]</span></sup></a> R. Schomburgh
attributes a large number of mounds made of snail shells, observed
by him near the mouth of the Orinoco river, to the Warrow
Indians, who are still living in that neighborhood. In the desolate
coast lands of the at present dry mouths of the Ica river in
Peru there are two enormous shellmounds which the writer has
visited. Even now there remain large parts of the wooden huts
which were left behind on these shellmounds by the last shell-eaters.
Painted pot-fragments, patches of woven fibres, and all
kinds of bones lie scattered about. It would be an easy matter to
show that the last inhabitants of the hill exhibited the later cultural
conditions which prevailed during the time of the Incas in
the valleys of Pisco and Ica, about 1460 A.D.</p>

<p>Returning to California, there can be no doubt that the hill-like
camp places of the Indians in the interior of the country
represented a local variation of the shellmounds along the shore.
The form and structure of these camping places resemble the
shellmounds of the coast. The material differs in part, since the
inhabitants of the inland had fewer shells at their disposal.
These camping places were inhabited by the Indians quite recently,
or are even now inhabited.<a id='r63'/><a href='#f63' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[63]</span></sup></a> The time when the shellmounds
of the Bay shore were vacated by their owners was therefore
probably not very long ago. With this view coincides the
fact that in the upper strata of the shellmound burial is represented
by cremation; a form of burial observed up to the most
recent times among the Indians of California. The white immigrants
settled first on the seacoast, and it is therefore natural
that the aborigines retreated earlier from their shellmounds than
their brethren in the interior did from their camp places.</p>

<p>Thus, while the history of the shellmounds of this region probably
reaches back more than a thousand years into the past, it
must have extended almost to the threshold of modern times.
The fact that their roots reached far back into the prehistoric
period of California does not prevent our seeing the tops developing
almost to the present day.</p>

In a similar manner, Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 449, closes a long general exposition
of the reasons which speak either for or against a relatively great age
of the shellmounds on the Atlantic coast, with the estimate of an age of at
least 1,000 years. His deductions are based upon geological reasons (the
sinking of the coast) and the dissimilarities of the cultural remains found in
the mounds. Peculiarly enough, D. G. Brinton, reasoning from the analogy
of the cultural character of the shellmounds with that of the Indian tribes
which the explorers met in this country, thinks he has found an argument
against a comparatively high age of the shellmounds. W. H. Dall considers
the lower strata of his well-explored Aleutian shellmounds to have an age
of about 1,000 years. (Contributions, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 53.)</p>

The old Indian camping place at Knight’s Landing (on the Fair
Ranch), at the mouth of a tributary of the Sacramento river, was inhabited,
according to authentic information (T. Coleman), as late as 1849 by 150-200
“Digger” Indians. They departed in 1865. The shells, of which only a
small number have been found, are of <span class='it'>Mytilus</span>. A similar mound in Colusa
county, 20 miles to the northwest, is still populated by Indians. The Wintun
Indians are still accustomed to obtain shells for food by diving into the
river. This caused Powers (<span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 233) to surmise that a race somewhat
like theirs might have erected these shellmounds.</p>

</div>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span><span class='sc'>Cultural Stages Represented.</span></h2>

<p>If we attribute to the shellmound an age representing many
centuries, cultural differences should be indicated in the successive
strata. For it is impossible that the cultural state of one and
the same place should have remained stationary for many centuries
and, even judging by the mass alone, the mound could not
have reached such a height in less than a considerable number of
centuries. In attempting to discover possible cultural differences
we unfortunately meet with several difficulties. The action of
the climate has destroyed in all the strata the objects which consisted
of perishable materials. Only the more resistant things remained.
But the perishable materials are frequently those in
which the decorative sense of man expresses itself most easily,
and in which cultural differences are most distinctly shown. A
further unfortunate circumstance arises from the general trend
to simplicity and primitiveness of the tools of the inhabitants of
all shellmounds. So that the visible cultural differences which
would generally appear with a people of changing forms of life
are imperfectly expressed. Finally, many objects give only partial
evidence as regards form and use, for they were often mutilated
previous to their deposition in the strata.</p>

<p>In examining the implements of successive layers of the
mound we find that awls and certain knife-like tools found in
nearly all known shellmounds are met with in all of the strata,
while ornaments consisting of <span class='it'>Haliotis</span> shells and other simple
objects of decoration made of shells, corresponding in general
appearance to those which are still in use among the Indians, are
met with in the graves of the VIth to the VIIIth strata. In the
deepest strata, however, there have not been found any bone
beads, ornaments of <span class='it'>Haliotis</span> shells, or saw-like tools such as are
known above the VIIIth stratum. Thus there is some support for
the suggestion that cultural differences are expressed in the history
of the mound.</p>

<p>One of the most striking differences indicating a change in
the character of the people whose cultural stages are represented
in the successive strata is found in the different forms of burial.
The use of cremation appears for the first time in the 4th stratum
and extends to the upper, completely undisturbed stratum (II).
In the IVth stratum out of 11 bone awls only 4 are calcined, while
in the IInd stratum 44 in 61. In the latter the great amount of
ash intermingled with calcined human bones becomes very noticeable.
Powers relates in his great work on the California tribes
that most of them practiced cremation, and concerning the Karok,
Yurok, and Wintun he relates that they bury their dead,
while the Yokuts under certain circumstances make use of both
customs. The inhabitants of the upper strata of the mound may
undoubtedly be assumed to have followed the customs of the majority
of modern Californian tribes in the disposal of their dead.
Contrasting with this custom is burial in the ground. In this
connection interesting evidence is furnished by the strata of this
mound: here at least cremation was preceded by interment. In
strata IV to VIII of this mound we find this custom prevailing,
and we are forced to assume it to have been practiced by the
population living on the mound during the time from the deposition
of the lower part of stratum VIII to that of the middle of
stratum V. In their manner of burial the knees were drawn up,
resting upon the side, resembling on the whole the mode of burial
in the shellmounds of Santa Barbara county in California, and
in those found in Oregon. Instead of suggesting that the mode
of burial is a recent one, the findings in the lower strata of the
mound at Emeryville might hint that possibly the shellmounds
of Southern California and Oregon are older than is at present
believed. The Yokuts likewise bury their dead with drawn up
knees, but whether lying on one side is not mentioned. Also of
the Wintun detailed information as regards their mode of burial
is missing. But even if a majority of tribes should still practice
the form which prevailed in the middle strata of the mound, this
would not change the fact that the whole mode of burial at this
place designates an earlier ethnical stage. The manner in which
the inhabitants of the lower strata of the mound—say from the
bottom portions of the VIIIth stratum to the bottom of the Xth—buried
their dead is not known, because no graves or other evidences
of burial appear in them. It is not impossible that their
mode of burial differed again from the two kinds of burial found
in the strata lying above.</p>

<p>Another striking difference between the upper and lower layers
is found in the characteristic implements of the strata. This
difference is best represented by a comparative table. In order
to understand this better, we give the relative volume of earth
moved for each stratum. In the table the volume of the VIIth
stratum (about 100 cubic feet) has been taken as the unit.
Bracketed figures in the different columns denote the number of
objects which might have been expected as the proportional content
of one of the middle strata. In the last two columns the
contents of the IXth stratum have for practical purposes been
used as a basis.</p>

<p>Parentheses in the 4th column denote the number of chipped
stones which may actually be assumed as tools.</p>

<p>It is evident that the character of the objects in the upper
strata is entirely different from that of the implements which
are found in the lower beds. Well polished stone implements and
obsidians diminish the nearer we come to the bottom. The sporadic
occurrence of a well polished stone implement in the 8th
stratum of the first column has an entirely abnormal aspect, in
view of the otherwise complete absence of such objects from the
VIth stratum downward. The abnormal increase of objects of
the 1st and 2nd kinds in the IInd stratum is doubtless due to the
custom of throwing their possessions into the fire during the cremation
of the dead. Still, the IInd stratum yielded a sufficient
number of fragments of similar objects which were evidently lost
in other ways. So few are furnished by the contents of the lower
strata that their limited use is apparently indicated. In fact,
even the Vth stratum shares this poverty, for its four polished
implements are only represented by fragments of metate-like
stones and a tablet of slate, polished on one side. In the lower
strata flaked stones (of local materials), bone splinters of an awl-like
shape, and knife-like tools of bone predominate. Among the
flaked stones, real implements are very numerous; they are missing
in the upper strata. Their technique is primitive. On one
side they are flat and are worked on the other side only. This
working, too, is crude, and the finishing primitive. The turtle-back
form is present. Different kinds of scraper-like tools of
primitive form, and of drill-like sharpened stone fragments, must
have been more common implements in the hands of the inhabitants
of this stage than among the dwellers on the upper strata,
where these tools are lacking.</p>

<p>A well formed implement of flaked stone, worked on both
sides, was found low down in stratum VIII (a spear-like blade,
<a href='#pl10'>pl. 10</a>, fig. 14). Strata IX and X offer nothing similar. The
leaf-like blade from stratum VIII (<a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, fig. 20), where a crude
workmanship is paired with an attempt at more regular sharpening
of the edges, does not favor the view that the inhabitants of
the mound had been well versed from the beginning in the production
of chipped implements.</p>

<p>Very remarkable is the occurrence together of crude splinters
of bone, which show from long use their real value as tools,
and the neat, almost elegant, knife-like implements. Among the
latter we find the only ornamental fragment of a tool of bone
obtained during the whole course of the excavation. The people
who used the splinters of bone for their tools were not so primitive
but that they possessed elegant objects of bone, and not so
far advanced but that they were often satisfied with such primitive
implements as common bone splinters. But both classes of
these typical tools are markedly different from what the upper
strata of the mound offer in the line of implements. Hence the
people of the lower strata must have represented a somewhat
different mental type or a different degree of mental training.</p>

<p>It seems advisable, from what we know, to separate the older
inhabitants who had settled here and raised the foundations of
the mound up to the middle part of the VIIIth stratum, from the
later population of the grave period. They may have been neolithic,
they may have been connected with the following generation
by some common traits, although there is little evidence
for this; but the two people certainly differed in cultural characteristics.</p>

<p>The race that commenced building in the middle of the 8th
stratum was apparently less different from the population of the
upper strata than from its predecessors. But differences can
here, also, be discovered. The chipped tools of local materials
still continue for some time (about to VII<span class='it'>a</span>), and obsidian seems
to have come to them as a rather rare material. Only a few bone
implements from grave 8 are extant in this group of strata. Contrasted
with the usage of the people of the upper strata is also
the use of bone arrow blades, which the last inhabitants of the
mound apparently did not possess. They had not yet departed
from an extended employment of bone as a working material; a
fact usually more characteristic of a primitive people than of one
further advanced.</p>

<p>One observation should still be made in this connection. It is
a striking fact that in the fifth stratum and its immediate proximity
a number of objects appear, the likeness of which was not
found elsewhere in the whole mound. They are:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'>(1) Fragments of metate-like stones, stratum V.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:7em;'>A long, dull, chisel-like tool of horn, from stratum V.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:7em;'>A tablet of slate polished on one side, stratum V.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'>(2) Pieces of antlers, truncated for use as tools, stratum V, and a knife-like implement, stratum V.</p>

<p>It seems possible that such sporadic types of tools were left
by a people that only temporarily inhabited the mound. Since,
however, up to the present time parallel investigations have furnished
but little material, such an hypothesis cannot be tested as
to its exactness; nor is it possible to state from what region they
might have come.</p>

Remains of pottery are found in quantities in the shellmounds on the
Atlantic Coast (cf. Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 43<span class='it'>a</span>), and also in those of other localities
(Brazil, Peru). They do not, of course, appear in California shellmounds

The specimens of bone implements recovered in shellmounds are of
great importance in the study of the use of such implements among primitive
peoples, since they are so rarely found in other fields of research (cf. also
Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 205). Still shellmounds greatly differ in this respect. While
bone implements are “quite abundant” in the shellmounds of New England,
the same as here (Wyman, Am. Naturalist. I, p. 581), the mounds in New
Jersey yield only one bone to every 3,000 stone implements. (Abbott, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>)</p>

<h2><a id='stone'></a>A. Implements made of Stone.</h2>

<h3>a. Made by Grinding.</h3>

<h4>1. Mortars.</h4>

<p>Stone mortars were among the most common and most useful
implements that the ancient inhabitants of the land possessed,
being used for the preparation of meal and for other purposes.
Correspondingly numerous therefore are these objects, found
mostly in fragments, and scattered through nearly all the strata
from the second to the tenth. There are three perfect specimens
and eleven fragments in our collection, nearly all made of lava.
The largest of the mortars, 1-9102, fig. 3, was recovered quite
accidentally near g in plan III at the extreme western end of
the mound. Judging from the place of its discovery, about 3-1/2
inches below the surface, the mortar must have been lost in about
the middle period while the foot of the mound was increasing
from n to p. Its outside surface is rough like the natural boulder,
it is 1 foot long by 9 inches wide and 7-1/2 inches high. Within it
is oval and measures 6 to 7 inches in diameter and 5 inches in
depth. The smaller mortar, 1-8705, fig. 4, was found in stratum
VI. On the outside it is rounded off and ornamented with engraved
vertical lines, which are intersected near the edge by a
horizontal one. The edge is partly worn away by use. Such
simple lines as an ornamentation of the outside are occasionally
observed on California mortars.</p>

<p class='caption'>Fig. 3. × 1/4. A large mortar.</p>
</div>

<p>1-8664, fig. 5, a small mortar from stratum III, is of different
shape, oval both in its outline and in cross section, the bottom
being slightly flattened; it has a rather small round cavity, 1-1/2
inches in diameter and one-sixth inch deep. It may have served
for the pounding up of substances which were used only in small
quantities, such as color pigments. The width of this mortar is
2-1/2 inches, its height and thickness 1-7/8 inches. Powers presents
a view of a similar specimen from California, a proof that this
type occurred in this region. A fragment, 1-8810 of the collection
from stratum VIII, may be the bottom of a similar utensil.</p>

</div>

<p>Some additional types of mortars are represented among the
fragments; they will be given below in the order in which they
were recovered. 1-8594, fig. 6, from stratum II, is one of several
fragments of this stratum and belongs to a relatively advanced
type, resembling a vessel. These stone vessels had a fairly even
thickness of the sides of about an inch, and were fashioned quite
regularly without and within. This rim is flattened and slopes inward.
The diameter of the complete mortars may have been a
foot. This type of mortar is quite common in California. The
collection from Santa Rosa Island in the University Museum
made by Dr. Jones contains several similar specimens. 1-8707
fig. 7, stratum IV, is an odd fragment. Its well fashioned bottom
part is surrounded by a rim which in turn is bordered by two
chambers which exactly correspond; the surface between them
is broken. This fragment may also have been part of a mortar,
although it is not possible now to restore it to any shape represented
among the familiar types. Fig. 8, 1-9077, shows a fragment
of a mortar recovered in the Xth stratum, and it is the only
one found lower than stratum VIII. It lay hardly an inch from
the base of the mound. It has a peculiarly jagged shape; the
<a id='bow'></a>convex exterior is the rough boulder stone, as are the uneven
sides, but the inner concave surface is ground down smooth. The
peculiar jagged shape may be explained by the fact that it is a
piece of a mortar, the rim of which by long usage had been worn
away in places, and as a result points were formed. The collection
of Dr. Jones from Santa Rosa contains a mortar with a
jagged rim, caused probably also by wearing away, but in that
case the points of the rim show some decoration, unlike the present
fragment. 1-8848, fig. 9, stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, may throw some
light on the possible cause of these indentations resulting from
long usage. In the latter specimen the surface of the bulging

<p>The small fragment, 1-8621, fig. 10, stratum II, has to be included
also in the class of mortar-like utensils. It is made of a
soft material resembling steatite, it curves as if it were a handle
and is broken off at one end, while the other rounded end shows
marks of blows. This object may be compared to the handle of
the cup-shaped vessel of steatite from Dos Pueblos in Southern
California and shown by Professor Putnam, l. c., pl. VI, fig. 5
(cf. l. c., p. 110). Similar utensils from Santa Catalina Island
and other places are mentioned there; hence it may be assumed
that this type of utensils was used by the occupants of the mound
during its last period.</p>

<h4>2. Flat Stones.</h4>

<p>It is only from three small fragments that the presence of this
type within the mound may be inferred. All three were recovered
in stratum V; one of them, 1-8751, is shown in figure 12.
Judging from the fragments, these grinding stones were square
in shape, about 1-1/2 to 2 inches in thickness and were worn smooth,
both on the horizontal surface and on the sides and ends. The
occurrence of flat grindstones is not unprecedented in California;
some have been found in Sonoma county<a id='r68'/><a href='#f68' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[68]</span></sup></a> and elsewhere. They
were perhaps used in the manufacture of shell ornaments and
beads.</p>

<h4>3. Pestles.</h4>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>Fig. 13. × 1/2. Pestle with depression on one side. Fig. 14. × 1/2. A grooved sinker. Fig. 15. × 1/2. Upper end of a pestle.</p>
</div>

<p>Many fragments having the usual form were found, but only
one was perfect, and that of unusual shape. 1-8670, fig. 13, was
recovered in cut A, 6 inches below the surface. It is 6-3/8 inches
long, 3 inches wide, and 2-1/8 inches thick, tapering toward the
pestle-like rounded end, the other end being flat. Marks on it
show that it was also used as a hammer. Sunk into one of the
sides, at about the center of gravity, is a long conical groove about
one-third of an inch deep; the opposite side shows the beginning
of another such groove. They may have been worn into the stone
by using the broad side of the implement in driving stakes, etc.
The beginning of a second groove, otherwise superfluous, on the
opposite side seems to bear this out, as do the marks on the surface
of the broad end. These latter indications are a proof that
the utensil was not used as a pestle only. This is not the only
instance of a pestle with side grooves. Ch. Rau pictures a very
similar one from Tesuque in New Mexico.<a id='r69'/><a href='#f69' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[69]</span></sup></a> Mr. Stevenson’s
opinion that the side grooves served for holding the pigment
which had just been ground by the pestle seems to be merely a
conjecture on his part. A stone was found in the West Berkeley
shellmound which seems arbitrarily to combine several purposes,—a
groove encircling it shows its use as a sinker, a semispherical
cavity which at its widest part breaks into the groove points to
its use as a mortar.</p>

</div>

<p>The 17 fragments of pestles of usual shape were fairly uniformly
distributed throughout all the strata, as was the case with
the mortars. However, 7 of these came from stratum II alone.
There were no peculiarities to be noted in the fragments as to
their forms. They were about 2-1/2 inches thick and were rounded
off at the lower end. The upper end sometimes tapered after a
conical swelling immediately next the grinding surface. They
were cut straight off at the upper end, unless indeed the abruptly
cut surface is the result of a previous breaking. Sharply pointed
or button-like ornamentations at the upper ends which are usual
in those found in California<a id='r70'/><a href='#f70' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[70]</span></sup></a> were not noticed. Figures 15 to 17
show three fragments,—1-8882, 1-8597, and 1-8666 from strata
VIII, II, and from the cut A. Of these, the first illustrates the
upper end of a pestle, the other two, lower ends.</p>

<p>The little object 1-8620 from stratum II, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 11,
seems to be best included under pestle stones. It is made of fine
grained stone, which would point to its use for more delicate
purposes. It is a truncated cone, with oval section, 1-1/8 inches
wide and 1-3/16 inches thick. The lower base is slightly arched
and, as can plainly be seen, is scratched slightly by use; a small
middle cavity in the narrow upper surface shows traces of asphaltum.
It may have been used as a pestle.</p>

<h4>4. Hammer-like Stones.</h4>

<p>Strangely enough, only two such implements were found in
this mound, while in the West Berkeley mound several that conclusively
belonged to this class were unearthed.</p>

<p>One of these, a boulder stone the size of one’s fist, oval in
shape and flattened, was found in the lowest stratum, X. The
marks of blows making the side edges uneven show its use as a
hammer. The other, 1-8720, fig. 18, from stratum IV, is one of
the familiar type having a groove for the insertion of the fingers.
It is a stone 3-1/4 inches long, 3 inches wide, and of an uneven
thickness not exceeding 1-5/8 inches, flattened off at its thickest
(lower) end. There is a depression in each of the broad sides.
The surface of the indentations is dotted with small holes. Similar
stones have been found in many places in the United States,—in
New Jersey, Pennsylvania,<a id='r71'/><a href='#f71' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[71]</span></sup></a> on the Aleutians,<a id='r72'/><a href='#f72' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[72]</span></sup></a> and elsewhere.
Abbott has pointed out the fact that the edges of some of these
stones could not very well have been used for hammering since
they do not show the signs of such usage. The stone in question
was evidently used in two ways,—as a hammer at the lower flat
surface, which is from five-eighths to 1-1/8 inches wide and in this
case provided with indentations serving for the insertion of the
finger; and as a hammer at the flat sides for the driving of stakes,
etc., in which case it was grasped by the rims. The pits in the
depressions were probably the result of this latter use of the implement.
The writer has noticed that just such flat stones were
used in Bolivia for the driving of stakes, and there, too, the broad
side which gave the blow was pitted. The material used is hard
sandstone.</p>

<h4>5. Flat Stones Pointed at both Ends.</h4>

<p>Two objects of this form, coming from stratum II, represents
a new type of implement. They are almost identical in shape.
One of them, 1-8604, is shown in fig. 19. They consist of long,
flat, quadrangular boulder stones, 3-5/8 and 3-7/8 inches long, with
an even width and thickness of 1-5/8 inches. Both ends are simply
sharpened to a point, and the broad sides, top and bottom, are
shaved off as far as the middle of the stone. In form, the stones
are similar to a wooden top of today.</p>

<h4>6. Sinker-like Stones.</h4>

<p>Stones of this description form a large class, exhibiting, however,
great diversities of shape. They all seem to have served the
same purpose since most of them show indisputable signs of such
usage.</p>

<p>About 18 stones of this kind were found in the mound. As
regards their varying form and utility, they may be classed as
follows:</p>

<p>I. Spherical and oval stones with a peripheral groove: Fig.
20, 1-8669, shows a spherical stone of this kind, found at a depth
of 5 feet in cut A. 1-8534, fig. 21, a fragment of an oval stone
with a groove about its largest circumference is from stratum I.</p>

<p>II. Flat boulder stones with notches in the corresponding
sides for fastening them: Two of these were found in the upper
strata; one, from stratum IV, is shown in figure 22.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>Fig. 20. × 1/2. Figs. 21 and 22. × 3/4. Sinker-like stones.</p>
</div>

<p>III. Stones with holes pierced through them by which they
were suspended: These form the type that may with the most
certainty be classed as sinkers. 1-8535, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 7, from
stratum I, is the only specimen of this class found.</p>

<p>IV. Pear-shaped and kindred stones; also conical pendant
stones: The fourth class is the largest, in that the greatest number
of shapes may be included in it. The following are to be
counted in with this class:</p>

<p><span class='it'>a.</span> Pear-shaped stones and others, though slighter, still very
like them. This type is represented by:</p>

<p>1. A perfect pear-shaped stone, 1-8611, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 2, from
stratum II.</p>

<p>2. More or less fragmentary bits, 1-8612, 3, the first without
a doubt, the second probably from stratum II. See 1-8613, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>,
fig. 1.</p>

<p>3. Five fragments of stones of a slenderer, less perfect though
similar form, 1-8614, 5 and 6 (<a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, figs. 5, 3, 8), 1-8617 and
1-8718 (<a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 4), the latter one from stratum IV, the
others from II.</p>

<p><span class='it'>b.</span> Inverted pear-shaped stones, some flat. This shape is related,
though distantly, to the above. Two fragments, 1-8618
and 1-8619, from stratum II, see 1-8618, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 6.</p>

<p><span class='it'>c.</span> A conical stone with slanting lower surface (1-8719, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>,
fig. 7) from stratum IV. It is very similar in shape to the
upper part of the pear-shaped stones.</p>

<p><span class='it'>d.</span> A pointed stone, 1-8925, from stratum VIII, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig.
9, which is only very distantly related to the pear-shape forms.</p>

<p>These stones belong to that class of objects which have been
interpreted at different times as being:</p>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';ml:3em;' -->
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>1. Weights for determining the vertical.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>2. Weights for weaving apparatus.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>3. Weights used in spinning.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>4. Weights used for fishing nets or lines.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>5. Ornaments.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>6. Medicine stones or charms.<a id='r73'/><a href='#f73' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[73]</span></sup></a></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p>A number of articles under class IV (Form IV<span class='it'>a</span>) are made
of hematite.<a id='r74'/><a href='#f74' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[74]</span></sup></a> Of the objects under consideration, 1-8925 (<a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>,
fig. 9) is made of the same. The use of hematite generally presupposes
that an implement is going to be employed as a weight.
Since the forms that belong to this class merge into one another
in an uninterrupted series, one is justified in assuming that they
were all weights.</p>

<p>It is further clear that the shape of the pear-like stones, which
have caused so much speculation, must have been fitted for some
particular purpose. This is to be inferred from the fact that
stones of like shape have been found in widely separated parts
of the United States outside of California, in Maine,<a id='r75'/><a href='#f75' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[75]</span></sup></a> Massachusetts,<a id='r76'/><a href='#f76' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[76]</span></sup></a>
Ohio,<a id='r77'/><a href='#f77' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[77]</span></sup></a> Illinois,<a id='r78'/><a href='#f78' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[78]</span></sup></a> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Furthermore, H. H. Bancroft<a id='r79'/><a href='#f79' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[79]</span></sup></a> has made the important assertion
that such implements are usually found in a mutilated
condition. This is borne out by the fact that out of the nine
pear-shaped and inverted pear-shaped stones represented by
groups 4<span class='it'>a</span> and 4<span class='it'>b</span>, there is only one which is perfect. It is to
be inferred from this that, however elaborately they are ornamented,
these implements were put to essentially practical uses.
Hence the theory that they were worn as ornaments or charms is
untenable.<a id='r80'/><a href='#f80' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[80]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The supposition that they were used on the end of a plumb
line is also invalid, since civilization was not far enough advanced
among the Indians for that sort of thing. Weaving and spinning
apparatus requiring the use of the stones as weights are so
rarely found that we cannot explain the presence of such a large
number of stones in that way. And especially not in California
since the Indians there have never spun nor woven.</p>

<p>Hence the only explanation left is that they were used in
fishing. The great quantities of such implements found on the
coast has often been noted.<a id='r81'/><a href='#f81' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[81]</span></sup></a> That nine were found in a shellmound
such as the one at Emeryville substantiates this theory.
They have also been noticed in a number of other shellmounds
about the bay (even though these have been little excavated), as
at Ellis Landing and in Visitacion Valley,<a id='r82'/><a href='#f82' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[82]</span></sup></a> and their shape is
identically the same (<a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 2). There is one from a shellmound
on Seaver’s Ranch with exactly the same shape, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>,
fig. 1. Drawings were made by J. Deans of two other objects
which were also taken from the same shellmound in Visitacion
Valley and which had like forms.<a id='r83'/><a href='#f83' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[83]</span></sup></a> If we accept the hypothesis
that these stones in general are sinkers, there are of course difficulties
in the case of individual stones, that must be explained
away.
The following peculiarities which appear must be mentioned:</p>

<p>1. Occasional peculiarities in material: Some are not very
heavy, some rather soft; and in others the ornamentation either
in color, grain, or crystalline markings is so prominent that an
ornamental use is suggested. 1-8615, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 3, seems to be
a stone of this description,—the material of which it is made is
reddish and fine grained, and ornamented to some extent.</p>

<p>2. The occasional absolute lack of any contrivance by which
the implement might have been suspended: 1-8925, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>,
fig. 9, is, for instance, of this kind. It is for the greater part of
its length absolutely round and gradually tapers to a point. The
outer end is in the form of a handle which is flattened to about
one-half inch wide and one-quarter inch thick and is rough from
the marks of blows; the main part of the instrument is smooth.
The handle-like part must, from its form and roughness, have
served to fasten it by. It looks, however, more as though it were
intended to fit into a shaft, rather than to be suspended. It is
important to note that one of the long sides is entirely covered
with asphaltum. This fact excludes the possibility that it was
fastened into a shaft. It must further be called to mind that, as
in the case of the California Indian dancing costume, various
rod-like bits of stone are sometimes fastened on by means of
hangers, the provision for their suspension being made on the
stones themselves. The use of asphaltum in securing them often
did away with otherwise necessary changes in their form. At
any rate it allowed great imperfection in form.</p>

<p>Fragment 1-8616, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 8, is an example of the above;
it is pear-shaped and the upper conical point is encircled by a
broad band of asphaltum which served for its attachment.</p>

<p>The sinker-like stones of classes I-III present fewer difficulties
in their explanation than do the pear-shaped and kindred ones.
The use of flat boulder stones with side grooves as net-sinkers is
agreed to by all.<a id='r84'/><a href='#f84' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[84]</span></sup></a> The fact that here as in the East, and as in
the shellmound of West Berkeley, many of these have been found
in groups, points almost conclusively to their use as net weights.</p>

<p>Professor Putnam has already called attention to the use of
spherical stones (fig. 20), with a peripherally encircling groove
as sinkers.<a id='r85'/><a href='#f85' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[85]</span></sup></a> Similar stones are also found in shellmounds in
Massachusetts and in the Aleutian Islands.</p>

<p>Dr. Yates<a id='r86'/><a href='#f86' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[86]</span></sup></a> was informed by an Indian that such was the use
of a stone found in Napa (California).<a id='r87'/><a href='#f87' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[87]</span></sup></a> The use of the oval
stones (as fig. 21) is in general to be explained in the same way.
A stone of that kind is, for example, known to have been found
in Oregon.<a id='r88'/><a href='#f88' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[88]</span></sup></a> Another one has been found in California (supposedly
at Spanish Flat). It has been pictured by H. H. Bancroft.<a id='r89'/><a href='#f89' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[89]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>The stone, 1-8535, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 7, from stratum I, is a sinker,
judging from its general shape; it is long and oval, pierced at
the upper end. Stones of like form have been found in numbers
in the shellmound at West Berkeley. They are probably sinkers
like many other stones found there.<a id='r90'/><a href='#f90' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[90]</span></sup></a> The upper eyelet has been
broken off in the stone under consideration. The stone is slightly
flattened; one of the end surfaces is more curved than the other
and one of the broad sides more elaborately adorned. On one
side a lattice-like ornamentation joins on to a deep groove. On
the other side may be seen several somewhat ruder lines like
hatchings. The material is that commonly used. Abbott describes
an ornamented stone pendent as a gorget and another one
from Illinois with plastic ornaments, as a sinker.<a id='r91'/><a href='#f91' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[91]</span></sup></a> Compare this
with a picture of a pendent stone from San Clemente Island.<a id='r92'/><a href='#f92' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[92]</span></sup></a>
The fact that these stones are ornamented seems to make their
use as sinkers doubtful but not impossible, since fishhooks are
sometimes much ornamented.<a id='r93'/><a href='#f93' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[93]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, fig. 8, 1-8630, is somewhat sinker-like, but in many
respects it diverges from the general class. It is made of very
light, soft stone, and is an elongated oval in shape, with five
grooves parallel to one another cut in about the edge. It is elaborately
ornamented with oblique hatch-like lines on the edges
between the grooves. Hence it is improbable that it was a sinker—it
cannot, however, as yet be assigned to another use.</p>

According to Dr. L. G. Yates, Bulletin 2 of the Santa Barbara Soc. of
Nat. Hist., the California Indians regard such pear-shaped stones as charms
and use them as such. This is analogous to their superstitious belief concerning
stone hatchets whose original significance has long been forgotten
and hence is no explanation of the original use to which these articles were
put.</p>

Spherical and oval stones with a peripheral groove are implements of a
very simple form and hence they lend themselves to different uses. The old
copper fac-simile of a stone hammer in the Museum of Science and Art in
Philadelphia shows conclusively for the region in which it was found, <span class='it'>viz.</span>,
Lake Titicaca, Pako Island, in Bolivia, that similar stones were used as
hammers.</p>

<h4>7. Cylindrical Stones.</h4>

<p>These differ from the pestles in that their diameter is smaller
and that they bulge out only slightly toward the middle. Two
objects of this kind came from stratum II, of which 1-8609 is
shown in <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 10. Both are broken at their ends. They
are respectively 4-13/15 inches and 2-5/8 inches long and fifteen-sixteenths
inch and 1 inch thick. The surface of the break in the
shorter one was subsequently smoothed off; perhaps by using it
as a pestle. Long cylindrical stones of this kind partly flattened
on one side and having encircling grooves at the tapering ends
have been pictured by Yates<a id='r94'/><a href='#f94' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[94]</span></sup></a> and Moorehead<a id='r95'/><a href='#f95' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[95]</span></sup></a>; these were found
at Santa Barbara, Southern California. To these may also be
compared a stone pendant from Tuolumne county<a id='r96'/><a href='#f96' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[96]</span></sup></a> pictured by
Moorehead, since the lack of complete ends in the stones gives
considerable room for speculation as to what the whole form
might have been. On the other hand, the tentative designation
of them by Moorehead and Yates as charms is in no way justified.
The better interpretation of their use would be that of sinkers
especially in the case of those provided at both ends with grooves
for attachment,<a id='r97'/><a href='#f97' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[97]</span></sup></a> since stones coming from Peru<a id='r98'/><a href='#f98' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[98]</span></sup></a> which are undeniably
sinkers are very like these in many respects.</p>

<h4>8. Needle-like Stone Implements.</h4>

<p>An awl, 1-8608, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 10, of stone, comes from stratum
II. <a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, fig. 9, 1-8711, from stratum IV, is pierced and similar
to the above though needle-shaped.<a id='r99'/><a href='#f99' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[99]</span></sup></a> From scratches appearing
on 1-8608 we infer that it was used on rather hard
materials.</p>

<h4>9. Tobacco Pipes.</h4>

<p>It is remarkable that tobacco pipes were found only in stratum
II; of these we have five perfect specimens and one fragment.
This bears out the statement made above, that stone utensils
well-made and smoothed off were found only in the upper
strata of the mound and particularly in stratum II. Since it is
not probable that the inhabitants of the lower strata were ignorant
of the practice of smoking, the absence of pipes must be explained
in some other way. On the one hand it is possible that
many of the older pipes were made of wood. Powers has described
a number of wooden pipes in use among the Indians of
today. On the other hand, it is possible that the practice of smoking
was not so common in remoter periods and therefore it would
be likely that fewer pipes would be found. There is a third possibility,
that the large number of pipes found in stratum II is
dependent on the method of disposing of the dead, so characteristic
of this stratum and which caused articles to be preserved
which would otherwise have disappeared. The pipes described
below represent two primitive types, with some insignificant
variations.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, figs. 2<span class='it'>a</span> and (cross section) 2<span class='it'>b</span>, 1-8622, represents
one type. It is made of a soft serpentine-like material, gray on
the broken surface and reddish brown on the outside. It is one
and seven-eighths inches long and incomplete. There is a broad
bowl-like part and a narrow neck or stem, a prolongation of it.
The bowl is conical, one and one-eighth inches long and of inconsiderable
width, being three-fourths of an inch in diameter. The
“boring” of the stem portion is cylindrical and eccentric.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, figs. 3<span class='it'>a</span> and 3<span class='it'>b</span>, 1-8623, is the only representative of
the second type. It is made of green serpentine, and is two and
one-sixteenth inches long, tapering into a tubular shape. The
hole in the stem is as above, only at the mouth end it is conical
and shorter. A groove is cut into the tapering end.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, figs. 1<span class='it'>a</span> and (in section) 1<span class='it'>b</span>, 1-8624, is made of soft
gray stone and is very similar to the preceding one, except that
it lacks the groove at the mouth end and that it is shorter and
thicker.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, figs. 4<span class='it'>a</span> and (in section) 4<span class='it'>b</span>, 1-8626, is a small cylindrical
object only nine-sixteenths of an inch long and seventeen-thirty-seconds
of an inch wide. The seven-sixteenth inch conical
hole takes up nearly the whole width of the stem so that the
rim surrounding it is sharp. The short conical boring at the stem
end is only five-sixteenths of an inch wide. The proof that this
too was used as a tobacco pipe lies in the fact of the disparity
of the two conical borings and in that the entire width of the
bowl end of the pipe is used to the best advantage. It seems to
have been more of a miniature or toy than an article in common
use. However, the quantity of tobacco needed to fill any of the
pipes could not have been great since the cone-shaped cavity in
the bowl is so small. One is here reminded of Schumacher’s
entertaining description of the way in which a Klamath tipped
back his head in order to raise his pipe vertically that he might
lose none of the tobacco. The stem ends of the pipes are equally
imperfect. They must certainly all have been fastened to a pipe-like
mouth-piece similar to the stone pipes which Professor Putnam
has pictured and described and which when unearthed still
had the mouth-pieces attached by means of asphaltum.<a id='r100'/><a href='#f100' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[100]</span></sup></a> Some
Indian pipes of today are fastened to the mouth-pieces by means
of ligatures,<a id='r101'/><a href='#f101' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[101]</span></sup></a> as was evidently the case with pipe shown in <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>,
fig. 3, and with another one of the collection (1-8625) the stem
of which had been broken. A rude notch was cut into the outside
of the stem to facilitate the rebinding and to give it a better hold.
At any rate, the means of attaching the mouth-piece (comp. particularly
figs. 1 and 4) was as inadequate as was the receptacle
for the tobacco at the front end. Short reed-like tobacco pipes
are particularly characteristic of the middle portion of California.
A stone tobacco pipe coming from a shellmound in Visitacion
Valley south of San Francisco, pictured by H. H. Bancroft,<a id='r102'/><a href='#f102' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[102]</span></sup></a>
is very similar to <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 3. The fourth one in the plate,
pictured by Powers, is also analogous. Short pipes are of course
also found in southern California,<a id='r103'/><a href='#f103' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[103]</span></sup></a> but the longer reed-like variety
is more usual. A tobacco pipe pictured by Marquis de
Nadaillac and coming from the cliff dwellers<a id='r104'/><a href='#f104' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[104]</span></sup></a> is somewhat similar
to <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 2, but here the stem was so slight that there
was no need of a special mouth-piece. The short pipes as well as
the long ones of southern California<a id='r105'/><a href='#f105' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[105]</span></sup></a> are also found in the
eastern part of the United States. Several clay pipes from New
Jersey<a id='r106'/><a href='#f106' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[106]</span></sup></a> may be compared to them; also two objects merely
classified as “pipes,” but most probably tobacco pipes, from
West Virginia<a id='r107'/><a href='#f107' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[107]</span></sup></a> and Tennessee.<a id='r108'/><a href='#f108' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[108]</span></sup></a></p>

<h4>10. Various Polished Stone.</h4>

<p>In the mound were found different kinds of stones,—some
isolated specimens showing good workmanship but as yet unclassified,
and others, of the common kinds which were, of course,
in use at the same time with the more perfect implements.</p>

<p>Those of the first kind were all found in stratum II. One of
these is 1-8671, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, figs. 12<span class='it'>a</span> and (front view) 12<span class='it'>b</span>. It is
made of soft serpentine. Its shape is that of a flat cylinder of
not entirely uniform height, with flat or almost imperceptibly
curved ends; there is a perforation which extends inward in the
form of a cone from both ends.<a id='r109'/><a href='#f109' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[109]</span></sup></a> In the gentle curving-out of
its peripheral surface it is particularly like ear-pegs. It is
worthy of note that Moorehead shows two objects from the neighborhood
of Stockton analogous to it in many respects and designated
by him as lip-pegs,<a id='r110'/><a href='#f110' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[110]</span></sup></a> and that barbed, bone spear-heads
like those used on the northwest coast were found in the vicinity
of Stockton, according to Mr. Meredith, in close proximity to a
lip-peg<a id='r111'/><a href='#f111' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[111]</span></sup></a> of the kind used on the northwest coast. The possibility,
therefore, of an ethnological connection between the ancient
inhabitants of the vicinity of the central California water
basins and those of the north cannot well be denied.</p>

<p>The small object, 1-8628, <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 13, seems similar in
size and form to the object shown in <a href='#pl12'>plate 12</a>, fig. 12. This similarity
is only a superficial one, aside from the difference in the
material of which it is made,—burnt clay, rare in California and
not carved but modeled; it is further different in the fact that
its cross section is oval and that its slightly arched end is covered
with marks of blows, and that the perforation is absent.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, fig. 6, 1-8631, is of quartz-colored material, flat and
tongue-shaped. It is broken off at the broad end, the lower surface
is flat, the upper slightly arched, and the edge blunt. Judging
from its form and the brittle nature of the material of which
it is made, it must have been an ornament.</p>

<p><a href='#pl12'>Plate 12</a>, fig. 5, 1-8850, of chalcedony, looks like a neckless
head of a bird resting on a bust-like body; the bill is linear; the
eye is represented by a deep hollow. That this object is not an
artifact is the conclusion suggested by the presence of a crust
over the entire object from beak to eye, formed by its weathering.
In relation to other products of human workmanship, such an
object has worth only in so far as its shape was of undoubted
significance to the inhabitants, and carefully preserved for that
reason.</p>

<p>Besides this, various flat, smooth stones of chert and agate
were found, one of which, 1-8849, from stratum VII, is shown in
fig. 23. It is made of fine grained sandstone, has but one smooth
side and was used as a whet-stone. A thin oblong sheet of mica-slate
was unearthed, but it must have been used only as an ornament.</p>

<p>Fig. 24 (1-8721 from stratum V) illustrates one of two analogous
objects from the upper strata of the mound. It is a common
stone with about seven groove-like lines of varying breadth
and depth on the sides. Two of them form an angle which
though purely accidental might seem to be ornamental. The
grooves come probably from its use as a whet-stone for bone awls,
etc. To this purpose the hard, sandy substance easily lent itself.
Long bars could not have been fixed to this stone, since for that
purpose the grooves are neither broad nor straight enough.
Several drawings by Rau<a id='r112'/><a href='#f112' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[112]</span></sup></a> and by Moorehead<a id='r113'/><a href='#f113' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[113]</span></sup></a> may here be
compared.</p>

<h3>b. Chipped Stones.</h3>

<p>A great number of these were found in the mound. As regards
their shape they fall into two classes, either finished implements
or chips from the workshop. As regards the material of
which they are made, they also fall into two large separate classes:
those of the usual, light stone natural to the place such as flint,
chert (in green or brown variety), horn-stone, jasper, etc., and
those of obsidian (volcanic glass), which was not to be had in
the immediate locality, although it was the preferred material.
The classification according to material is the more important.
There were found about twenty-five obsidian objects (among
them a very few rough pieces or waste bits from the workshop,
the latter all small) and about 140 hewn stones of other kinds of
material. Most of these were waste from the workshop, all of
the size of implements, but relatively few (about one-fourth)
complete tools.</p>

<p>The obsidian implements came from the Ist to the IXth strata,
but most of them were found in the upper layers. Nearly three-fourths
of them were taken from the three upper strata. In
stratum II alone there were ten implements and one piece of
obsidian in the rough. It can certainly be inferred that the great
quantity of obsidian tools from II was connected with the custom
of burning the dead and of casting their belongings into the
flames. In addition, the great number found here shows a
broader and more universal use of obsidian in the making of
implements.</p>

<p>They are all of very simple form, such as arrow-and spear-heads,<a id='r114'/><a href='#f114' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[114]</span></sup></a>
spear-like points and a flat knife-like blade, made from
the rough stone by polishing off bits<a id='r115'/><a href='#f115' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[115]</span></sup></a> (see <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, figs. 11 to
16). Arrow-heads of obsidian were found only in stratum II,
comp. 1-8676, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 13, the blade-like knife, 1-8633, fig.
11, and the spear-like knife end, 1-8634, fig. 16, which were
found there. 1-8926 from stratum VIII, fig. 15, may have been
either a spear-head or a knife. Fragment 1-8536 from stratum I,
fig. 12, by virtue of its two unevenly arched surfaces, and 1-8883,
fig. 14 of the plate, from stratum VIII (found nineteen feet
down in the tunnel between parts 8 and 9 of the shaft frame) on
account of its long peg-like lower end, may be parts of knife-like
implements. They were fastened on rod-like shafts similar to
the fine-handled knives of southern California shown by Professor
Putnam and which are in an excellent state of preservation.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, it is worthy of note that implements
of such perfect workmanship as figs. 12<a id='r116'/><a href='#f116' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[116]</span></sup></a> and 13 were not
found among the obsidian implements of the lower strata of the
mound. A proportional decrease in obsidian implements of good
workmanship can be noted as one approaches the lowest strata.</p>

<p>In northern California obsidian is found near Mt. Shasta, on
the north side of Mt. St. Helena and in pieces to the size of an
ostrich egg in Napa Valley.<a id='r117'/><a href='#f117' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[117]</span></sup></a> It is a product of volcanic eruptions,
phenomena which were of frequent occurrence during the
tertiary period. The material of which the implements found
about the bay in all the shellmounds were made must have come
from one of the above-named sources through trading. The small
number of such implements found in the shellmounds is probably
the result of the comparative rarity of the obsidian in this
locality and the resulting care with which it was hoarded.</p>

<p>It is to be inferred that at no period was obsidian exclusively
the material used for chipped stone implements, since workshop
waste composed of materials found in the neighborhood has been
discovered up to stratum II. Since, however, waste and no finished
implements of local materials have been found above stratum
V, the instances of the use of such must have been relatively
isolated in the upper strata. Toward the lower strata, from about
the VIIth but practically from the VIIIth on, there is a great
increase in workshop waste. Stratum V is the uppermost one out
of which one or two single objects (among them 1-8756, <a href='#pl6'>plate 6</a>,
fig. 21) may be considered finished implements. Of the thirty-nine
implement-like objects obtained in excavating, only one is
of unusual workmanship, an arrow-head of chert, 1-8815, <a href='#pl6'>plate 6</a>,
fig. 19, which comes from stratum VII, at the lowest part of
cut C. The extraordinary accumulation of objects of chipped
stone which can be termed implements begins with stratum VIII
and continues down to the lowest stratum X. A considerable
number of these is shown in <a href='#pl6'>plate 6</a>. It is, however, remarkable
that of these not one shows in its workmanship complete mastery
in the handling of the material. The implement which, though
still crude, shows the next best workmanship is the leaf-like point
of crystalline rock, 1-8929, <a href='#pl6'>plate 6</a>, fig. 20, from stratum VIII,
found at the innermost end of the gallery.<a id='r118'/><a href='#f118' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[118]</span></sup></a> All of the remaining
implement-like objects of chipped stone bear the marks of
crudity as do all of those that come from strata IX and X. It is
very noticeable that because of this crudity in most of them, the
line between implement and waste is very vague. It was therefore
difficult to decide in the case of many objects whether they
were to be regarded as tools at all. On the other hand, it is probable
that a number of pieces included under rubbish may have
really served as tools.<a id='r119'/><a href='#f119' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[119]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Resulting from the discovery of obsidian, <a href='#pl10'>plate 10</a>, fig. 15,
chipped stones of good workmanship were found as far down as
the upper part of stratum VIII. It is extremely doubtful
whether they appeared at all in the strata below this. The objects
made of material from the vicinity of the mound were certainly
made during its settlement. A characteristic mark of the
uniform crudity of all of these tools made of local materials and
found in the lower strata is that they all are worked from but
one side and that the elaboration of that side is accomplished by
but a very few strokes. The only exception to this is the point,
from stratum VII, <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, fig. 19, which as to technique belongs in
another place. <a href='#pl6'>Pl. 6</a>, fig. 18, 1-9012, shows a ridge-like elevation
on its lower side, thus forming an unimportant and superficial
exception. The point, 1-8929, <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, fig. 20, is also entirely even
on its under side. In this they have a peculiarity characteristic
of the well known “turtle-backs.”<a id='r120'/><a href='#f120' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[120]</span></sup></a> This latter kind which in
the eastern states of the United States has been found typical
of the implements of the palaeolithic age is to be recognized in
two objects in our collection, 1-9095, of green chert, <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, fig. 2,
from stratum X, and 1-9007 of a crystalline substance, <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>,
fig. 1, from stratum IX. The first of these is without a doubt an
implement, and the second is probably one. The palaeolithic
turtle-backs of the East are unmistakably to be differentiated
from the two objects under question in the material of which
they are composed, which is argillite. In any case, however, the
presence of these two objects proves that primordial species of
stone implements existed into the neolithic period (for the mound
rests on alluvial soil) and they may give ground for the establishing
of the period from which such implements date, which is
even farther back than that. The conical piece of jasper brought
to a point by chipping, 1-8851, <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, fig. 3, from stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>,
illustrates how implements were made by chipping from larger
pieces of stone, and may even be itself a tool. It cannot be stated
indisputably that the greater number of the common forms of
chipped stones shown on <a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a> were obsolete among the latter
inhabitants of the mound. But it must be noted that the greater
number and the most characteristic of them do not appear in the
upper strata. We may surmise that as far as they did occur
among the founders of the upper strata they had a better form.
In addition to the pointed (<a href='#pl6'>pl. 6</a>, figs. 19 to 20) and knife-like
implements (fig. 21) the following important types are represented.</p>

<p>1. Long scrapers sharpened on one side, 1-9012, fig. 18, from
stratum IX, and 1-9093, fig. 17, from stratum X.</p>

<p>2. Chisel-like tools terminating in front in a straight sharp
edge, 1-8857, fig. 14, from stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, and 1-9080, fig. 15,
from stratum X.</p>

<p>3. Scrapers, more or less rounded off or oval, 1-9023, fig. 8,
from stratum IX, 1-9053, fig. 9, from stratum IX, 1-9085, fig.
10, from stratum X.<a id='r121'/><a href='#f121' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[121]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>In a like manner the following irregularly shaped objects
might have been used as scrapers.</p>

<p>1-9043, fig. 7, from stratum IX.</p>

<p>1-8966, fig. 11, from stratum VIII or IX.</p>

<p>1-9012, fig. 12, from stratum IX.</p>

<p>1-9040, fig. 13, from stratum IX.<a id='r122'/><a href='#f122' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[122]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>4. Oval stones with high “turtle-back” backs with the encircling
edges sharpened, probably too large for use as the usual
scrapers:</p>

<p>1-9007, fig. 1, and 1-9095, fig. 2.</p>

<p>5. Drills or awl-like, pointed stones, with a more or less thick
base.</p>

<p>1-8961, fig. 6, from stratum VIII or IX.</p>

<p>1-9005, fig. 5, from stratum IX.</p>

<p>1-9031, fig. 4, from stratum IX.</p>

<p>Instruments like the last have been found in many parts of
the United States.<a id='r123'/><a href='#f123' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[123]</span></sup></a> Several of these bear a great resemblance

<h2><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>B. Utensils of Bone, Horn, and the Teeth of Animals.</h2>

<h3>Implements of Bone.</h3>

<p>Artifacts of animal derivation appear in great numbers and
in a great variety of form among the objects recovered in excavating.
This diversity in form is of course partly the result of
the different kinds of bone used in their manufacture, partly of
their varied manipulation, and partly of the uses to which they
were put. There are all grades of elaboration from the most
common splinter of bone to the tool whose shape is almost entirely
different from that of the bone employed. All the objects found,
however, may be reduced to the principal types of bone instruments
which have been found in the United States under the most
varying circumstances. In addition to awls, needles and paper-cutter-like
knives of bone, there are instruments of horn used
principally for chiseling and instruments of a secondary nature.
They were the usual tools used in making clothes,<a id='r128'/><a href='#f128' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[128]</span></sup></a> in weaving
baskets,<a id='r129'/><a href='#f129' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[129]</span></sup></a> etc., not to mention several subordinate uses to which
they were put.</p>

<h4><a id='awl'></a>1. Awl-like Tools.</h4>

<p>This is a large class containing more than 100 objects having
various secondary forms and it is the most conspicuous class of
bone instruments. They may be classified as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span></p>

<h4>a. Common Awls with a Good Point.</h4>

<p>These comprise more than 100 perfect and fragmentary specimens.
They were scattered through almost all the strata in the
following way:</p>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';ml:3em;' -->
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum I—8 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum II—61 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum III—8 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum IV—11 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum V—3 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum VI— — objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum VII-VIII—5 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum IX—5 objects.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:3em;'>Stratum X—4 objects.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p>The remarkable preponderance in stratum II is probably
again the result of the practice of cremation of bodies.</p>

<p>When one remembers that awls were the principal tools used
in making baskets and that baskets took the place of pottery in
the household of the California Indians, one will not wonder at
their great number.</p>

<p>Their shapes vary. Four of them are shown in <a href='#pl9'>plate 9</a>, figs.
1 to 4. Fig. 1, from stratum I, gives the type by far the most
common in the 3 or 4 upper strata; the other three, fig. 2, 1-8686,
from stratum IV, fig. 3, 1-8897, from VIII, fig. 4, 1-8972, from
IX, give examples of the many secondary forms and illustrate
the diversity of form occurring in the lower strata. Although
fig. 4, as regards its shape, reminds us of the type of the tool of
the upper strata (cf. fig. 1), not a single implement was found
in the lower strata that was the exact counterpart of those in the
upper. Manifestly it was the inhabitants of the upper strata who
developed and established the latter form. Its distinctive feature
is this, that only one side of the bone (mostly tibia of deer) is
used, that a foot-like portion of the joint is left, and that the awl
is sharpened and well finished off on all sides, even to the inner
channel. Usually there is a slight bulging out in the middle of
the tool which increases its strength.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 2, is that only the shaft
of the bone is open, the joint being left intact. In <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, figs. 3
and 4, the foot-like supports are missing; whether originally they
were there or not is a question. They seem to have been missing
from the very beginning, at least the one shown in <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 3.
The whole shape of the instrument is crude. In several awl-like
implements of the lower strata, as in text-fig. 25, 1-8797, from
stratum VII, the canal in the bone is not even opened, but kept
intact through the whole instrument.<a id='r130'/><a href='#f130' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[130]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span></p>

<p class='caption'>Fig. 25. × 1/2. A bone, probably used for an awl. Fig. 26. × 1/2. Bone implement of unknown use.</p>
</div>

<p>The absence of points indicates a somewhat different use to
which such instruments were put. In addition to this feature
there is very frequently a peculiar curve which, while it is the
natural shape of the bone, must have been chosen purposely,—for
instance, 1-8692, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 5, from IV, and 1-8829, text-fig. 26,
from stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>. The bone of front leg of a stag is the original
form of the partly awl-shaped partly paper-cutter-like implement,
1-8579, text-fig. 27, from stratum II. A similar one from
the southern part of the United States has been observed.<a id='r131'/><a href='#f131' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[131]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<h4><a id='flat'></a>c. Flat Awl-like Implements.</h4>

<p>These represent a large and important class of implements
which occur in numbers in several of the lower strata (V and
IX), although really only in fragments; cf. 1-8985, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 6,
from stratum V. They are curved sideways, and well-pointed in
spite of their otherwise flat character. The interior reticulate
structure of the natural bone is retained on one side of the
implement.</p>

<p>Fig. 28, 1-8541, from stratum II, has a peculiar shape; it is
broad, in the form of a channel and pointed. One of the edges of
the channel seems to be worn smooth through usage. The back
end is broken off.</p>

<h4>2. Needle-like Implements.</h4>

<p>They differ from the awl-like implements in that they are
intended not only to pierce an article but also to pass through it.
In this class there are also secondary shapes.</p>

<h4>a. Straight Needles without Perforation.</h4>

<p>1-8895, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 8, found twenty-seven feet beneath the surface
in stratum VIII, may be taken as the prevailing type. The
needle is a thin, pointed instrument, oval in cross section, blunt
at the back end, well finished throughout. To this class also belongs
a number of fragments found in different strata up to the
VIIIth.</p>

<h4>b. Curved Needles.</h4>

<p>1-8901, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 9, from stratum VIII, represents this type.
The needle is very slender and thin and of good workmanship.
Unfortunately it is broken off at the <a id='smo'></a>smooth posterior end.<a id='r132'/><a href='#f132' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[132]</span></sup></a></p>

<h4>c. Needles with “Eyes.”</h4>

<p>We have also only one specimen of this type, 1-8735, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>,
fig. 10, from stratum V. It is straight, round in cross section and
tapering at the perforated end.<a id='r133'/><a href='#f133' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[133]</span></sup></a> The bluntness of the point
must be the result of use.</p>

<h4>d. Long Crooked Needles.</h4>

<p>1-8831, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 7, a well preserved and seemingly perfect
specimen, was found in stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>, in the tunnel, from eleven
to fourteen feet below the surface. It consists of a long, thin rib
pointed at the stronger end, thereby exposing the canal within.<a id='r134'/><a href='#f134' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[134]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Among those found there is also a needle of fish bone and likewise
one made from the spine of a stingray.</p>

It reminds one somewhat (in that it is curved and pointed) of an instrument
designated, and that manifestly wrongly, by Moorehead as a hair-pin
(see Moorehead, <span class='it'>l. c.</span>, p. 271, fig. 410, under No. 4). Jeanne Carr tells
of needles made usually of the strong wing bones of the hawk, used to keep
the strands in place when the basket weaver left his work. These were
handed down from mother to daughter generation after generation and regarded
as valuable possessions. (The Californian, 1892, No. 5, p. 603.)</p>

</div>

<h4>3. Rough Awl-like Implements of the Lower Strata.</h4>

<p>We have chosen to discuss a number of implements from the
lower strata under this separate head. Although some of these
were probably used as awls, yet along with others with which
they form a small group they cannot easily be considered with
the other implements of this class. <a href='#pl7'>Plate 7</a>, which represents
typical bone implements of the lower layers, shows the greater
number of these peculiar shapes in figs. 1 to 10. Altogether about
fourteen of these awl-like implements were found in stratum
VIII, five in stratum IX and four in stratum X. When one considers
that from layers IX and X, only small sections were explored,
the relative number of these implements must excite some
interest. The awl-like and needle-like objects of <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, although
but little worked, are yet characterized by a definite fundamental
form, different from that shown in the objects represented in
<a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, figs. 1 to 10.<a id='r135'/><a href='#f135' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[135]</span></sup></a> They represent simply bone splinters of
the most varied forms such as would be made by accident. To
be sure, there were isolated bone splinters in other places in the
excavation, probably used as implements, as would naturally
occur in a shellmound. In all of these latter cases, however, the
character of the objects was, owing to the form of the bones and
to the accidental or typical intention of their use, completely
different. The objects shown in figs. 1 to 10 of this plate are
made of fragments of somewhat thick long bones. All of them
have been much used and the upper ends are strongly rounded
and worn. Their use was evidently intentional both with reference
to their more general and their typical uses. They do not
belong to a peculiar type of implements because it is evident
from their form that they were used for many purposes.</p>

<p>Some, as figs. 6, 7, and 8, 1-8919, 1-8918 (VIII), 1-8979
(IX), have an awl-like pointed form and may accordingly have
been used as such an implement. Others, as figs. 1, 3, 4, and 10,
1-8983 (VIII), 1-9069 (X), 1-9068 (X), 1-9072 (X), although
in general awl-like, are blunter and can hardly have been put to
the same use as these forms just mentioned. Objects like 1-8980,
<a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, fig. 5; 1-8996, <a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, fig. 9, and possibly also 1-8871, <a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>,
fig. 2, have such broad and blunt ends that for them characterization
as “awl-like” would be entirely unsuitable and their use
must be explained in some other way. The tie that holds them
together is, therefore, in no way that of similar use but rather of
analogous origin. They comprise a large number of implements
having different uses. What is common to them is the similarity
of the way in which they were obtained. Their use was determined
by the chance form which they thereby received. There
is before us then a class of the most primitive ethnological implements
of which we have knowledge, in which, as in the oldest
known implement of the human period, the natural form of the
object determines the use, rather than the use the individual
form.</p>

<h4>4. Implements of the Shape of Paper-cutters.</h4>

<p>It is natural that in so large a number of bone implements this
shape also should be represented. Five belonging to two different
types have already been discussed under the grave finds.
Altogether the amount of material of this character obtained
from the upper strata of the mound is remarkably small. Only
a small number of fragments were found, of which only a fragment
of the point, 1-8803, from stratum VIII is represented in
fig. 29.</p>

<p>In the deeper strata the case was entirely different. There
are from these layers no perfect implements, only fragments, but
their number is in proportion to what one would expect, or even
greater. Some of these show a variety of form and a degree of
ornamentation which was hardly to be expected among the finds
of the mound in general and least of all among the specimens
obtained from the lower strata. Little as the well formed
implements, which the fragments figured in <a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, figs. 11-17,
represent, appear to resemble the rough awl-like implements on
the same plate and which have been derived from the same strata,
there is yet no doubt possible that the two classes of implements
must have been used by the same people.</p>

<p>We have therefore the task, instead of denying the contrast,
of suggesting some solution for it.</p>

<p>These paper-cutter-like implements have a moderate width
and a thickness of only one-thirty-second to one-sixteenth of an
inch. They are well worked in all cases. The objects shown in
fig. 12, 1-8989 (IX), fig. 14, 1-8987 (IX), fig. 15, 1-8920 (VIII),
fig. 13, 1-8988 (IX), of <a href='#pl7'>plate 7</a> show artistic forms differing from
the simpler types of implements. Perforation, which in the bone
implements of the mound is very infrequent, is in these implements
alone found four times on the lower end. The notch on
the lower end of <a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, fig. 14, probably the remnant of a circular
section, is very artistic and one notices also curved lines on the
surface about it. These show the geometric accuracy with which
this work was carried out. 1-8986, <a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, fig. 16, from stratum
IX, is the only piece of bone among all those recovered from the
mound which has been engraved with geometric figures.</p>

<p>Out of the strongly varying yet constantly artistic characters
of these fragments we are justified in drawing the conclusion
that a much greater variety of implements of this form was used
by these people. The variations seem to have been influenced
largely by personal taste.</p>

<p>1-8875, fig. 11, represents a small fine point of a well formed
small paper-cutter-like implement.</p>

<p>1-8989, fig. 12, stratum IX, is a quadrate piece of bone cut
out of a “paper-cutter” and was possibly used in play.</p>

<p>1-8988, fig. 13, stratum IX, is the lower end of a “paper-cutter”
with parallel sides and obliquely truncated at the lower
end with a remarkably perfect perforation.</p>

<p>1-8987, fig. 14, stratum IX, is the lower part of a thin “paper-cutter”
with a semi-circular notch. The base shows broken
surfaces next the notch.</p>

<p>1-8920, fig. 15, stratum VIII, the lower, triangular part of a
“paper-cutter,” which has been very broad and thin, has a small
perforation.</p>

<p>1-8986, fig. 16, stratum IX, the middle fragment of a well-worked
“paper-cutter” ornamented with geometric figures.</p>

<p>1-8984, fig. 17, stratum IX, is the oblong upper part of a very
thin, well-worked “paper-cutter” with a perforation. The upper
part is broken off.</p>

<p>At this place there should probably be mentioned also the
small bar of bone, 1-8975, fig. 18, stratum IX, as it also comes
from this stratum. This is likewise an uncommon form of implement.
It is small and well worked, although not of the paper-cutter
type. It is oval in cross section and has a small paper-cutter-like
lower end which shows that it was fastened to some
other object. Its upper end is broken.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span></p>

<h4>5. Pointed Implements.</h4>

<p>In the middle strata of the mound there were found about
eight pointed bones, of which the types are figured in <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, figs.
11-16.</p>

<p>1-8869, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 11, stratum VII, is 2-1/8 inches long, oval in
cross section and having an inferiorly constricted neck. There
is a small hook on the lower end of the broad side. A small fracture
on the opposite side appears to indicate that there were
originally two such hooks.</p>

<p>1-8868, fig. 12, stratum VIII, is two inches long. This specimen
is in general similar to the one just mentioned. There is
only one hook at the lower end. The side opposite is without a
hook and is unbroken. Similar is 1-8738, from stratum V. An
analogous object is figured by Moorehead, page 273, fig. 412, No.
3, from Stockton Channel.</p>

<p>1-8916, fig. 13, stratum VIII, 2 inches long, is similar to the
last with the differences that the small broad, flat hook points toward
the broad side, and that the pointed end has been smoothed
by use. On this end there are also small traces of asphaltum
which indicate that a cord had sometime been wound about it
to fasten it to some other object.</p>

<p>1-8917, fig. 14, stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span> or VIII, 1-7/15 inches long with
a rounded cross section, is slightly curved and gradually narrows
towards the lower point. The convex side shows a slight flattening.</p>

<p>1-8870, fig. 15, stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span> or VIII, is 1-1/2 inches long, but
the lower end is incomplete. The cross section is oval to flat; it
shows on the broad side a sloping groove.</p>

<p>1-8694, fig. 16, stratum IV, an implement 2-3/15 inches long,
is typically knife-like in its form in so far as it has a broad blade-like
part. It is sharp on one side, blunt on the other and rounded
at the upper end. It is bent well backward. At the lower end it
runs out into a small neck-like portion which is extended in the
same line with the back of the implement and is broadened at the
base.</p>

<p>The objects already described and shown in figs. 11, 13, 14, 15,
and 16 of <a href='#pl9'>plate 9</a> represent the principal types. Among these
the knife-like object, fig. 16, is, judging from its shape, evidently
to be separated from the others.<a id='r136'/><a href='#f136' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[136]</span></sup></a> Numerous other knives of
obsidian occur in addition to this one of bone.</p>

<p>Of the remaining, fig. 14 represents a typical arrow point
made of bone such as are used in various parts of the world, <span class='it'>e.g.</span>,
in South America. The convex, slightly flattened side was laid
against the slightly truncated upper end of the shaft of the arrow
and was fastened to it by numerous coils of cord. The figure of
a similar arrow point from the Swiss Pile Dwellings is given in
Ranke’s work, Vol. II, pp. 5-19, fig. 11. This shows very well the
manner of attachment.</p>

<p>The similarity of the remaining bone points, figs. 11, 13, 14,
15, is so significant that a similar use is to be ascribed to them.
That they were used as fishhooks, which might be conjectured,
there appears to be less evidence. It is worth considering that
Mr. Meredith found on the breast of a single skeleton 51 objects
of the form shown in <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 14. In another case 28 such objects
were found.<a id='r137'/><a href='#f137' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[137]</span></sup></a> In the first case, with the skeleton in addition
to these were found <a id='spo'></a>two long spear points with barbs such
as are used on the northwest coast of America. A large number
of objects from one grave and the association with other analogous
objects supports very strongly the idea that the pointed
bones were used for the points of arrows. The neck of these
points was the portion about which the cord was wound and about
this was laid a small quantity of asphaltum to hold the cord in
place, while the hooks had the object of preventing the cord from
sliding off from the neck. The form of the hooks varies but
slightly. This suggests the prominent hooks at the base of the
arrow points of stone. In a certain way these arrow points may
possibly be considered as a middle form between long bone points
provided with barbs, such as were used by the Eskimo, and the
Indian arrow points of stone. In this connection it is worth noting
that Mr. Meredith finds them in association with such bone points
(also with a lip-plug such as are used on the northwest coast of
America). The form of the Indian stone arrow-heads might have
been imitated in the North in other materials.</p>

<p>That the analogy with the more northerly races is not limited
to the burial layers of the mound from which the pointed implements,
<a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, figs. 11, 15, were found is indicated by the object,
<a href='#pl7'>pl. 7</a>, fig. 12, which was found in the cremation layer, No. 2.</p>

<h4>6. Saw-like Notched Bones.</h4>

<p>The excavations furnish twelve objects of this type of implement,
of which perhaps half were from stratum II. The remainder
were found from the lower strata up to the eighth. Quite a
number of the objects from stratum II were calcined, an evidence
that they were deemed of value in life since they were burned
with the dead.</p>

<p>The best preserved type of this implement, of which in most
cases only small fragments were found, is shown in 1-8898, <a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>,
fig. 17, stratum VIII.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>Figs. 30 and 31. × 1/2. Notched bones perhaps used in net-making or weaving.</p>
</div>

<p>Nearly all of these objects have a stereotyped form, being
made from the shoulder blade of some large mammal, probably
the deer. One, however, seems to have been made from a bird
bone (1-8900, fig. 30, stratum VIII). On the specimen shown in
<a href='#pl9'>pl. 9</a>, fig. 17, about half of the length is taken up by the rounded
handle, using the ridge-like end of the bone for this purpose.
The other end of the object is incomplete, but according to the
form in other specimens it was probably cut off squarely at the
end. At any rate only a small piece of the implement is missing
since the teeth cut into the thin convex margin of the bone are
complete to the number of 15. The ridge-like edge runs next to
the row of teeth, giving the implement greater firmness. The
teeth vary considerably in different objects in size, in form, and
in regularity (compare 1-8573, fig. 31, from stratum II). They
also vary in degree of wear, which so far as observed is sometimes
seen on the edge and sometimes in the spaces between the
teeth. On one specimen the opposite edges of the bone are similarly
toothed, although one side of the bone was quite thick. A
smoothing or polishing of the object is never to be noticed, excepting
on the under side.</p>

<p>Similar objects have frequently been found in California.
Single fragments are figured by Moorehead.<a id='r138'/><a href='#f138' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[138]</span></sup></a> As similar as
these objects are to saws, it is probable that they were not used as
such. The name “sachos” given to these implements by the
Napa Indians, who possibly did not know their former use, is not
to be taken as the slightest support for the idea that they were
actual saws. In the first place it is hardly necessary to mention
that the concept “saw” is missing among the Indians. The
form of these objects and the general state of wear as already
described shows that they were not and could not have been used
as saws. It is remarkable enough that saw-like implements
made of bone have a distribution much more extended than the
Californian region. Since these occurrences are mostly local and
entirely independent of each other, these implements must in
their production have served certain practical aims. Why, however,
saws made of bone should have such a wide distribution it is
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>An analogous implement has been found in a shellmound in
Massachusetts and figured by J. Wyman. He also in his description
has shown that judging from the width of this implement
it could not have been used as a saw.<a id='r139'/><a href='#f139' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[139]</span></sup></a><a id='r140'/><a href='#f140' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[140]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Another saw-like toothed bone implement was found in the
cave dwellings in Franconia (Bavaria), which were inhabited in
the early neolithic period. This has been described by Ranke as
probably used in weaving.<a id='r141'/><a href='#f141' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[141]</span></sup></a></p>

<p>An implement having almost identical form as this just described
above was figured by J. Murdock. This object was obtained
from the Pt. Barrow Eskimo and was made of the shoulder
blade of a reindeer. He received it as a model of a saw said to
have been used before the introduction of iron.</p>

<p>After having made inquiries for the primitive form of the
implement, this specimen doubtless was made for him.<a id='r142'/><a href='#f142' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[142]</span></sup></a> His
paper also contains a figure of another saw-like implement, of
about twice the size of the first, made of antler. There was with
this a kind of shuttle and a form of weaver’s sword with the statement
that these three implements had been used in weaving
feather girdles. In watching the process of making these belts
he had, however, not seen any of these three implements.<a id='r143'/><a href='#f143' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[143]</span></sup></a> In
the opinion of the writer there is no reason to doubt materially
the accuracy of the statements concerning the use of these implements
by the Eskimo. It therefore contains the key to the understanding
of all the remaining forms of this type of saw-like implements
found in the northern region. And this explanation
may be extended to the wrongly determined Californian bone
saws. In our opinion the bone implement first figured by J. Murdock
shows simply that the Eskimo remembered having had such
an implement and that they gave to him the impression that it
had been used in the way in which the investigator was inclined
to think it ought to have been used. It appears that Ranke was
on the right track when he supposed the Frankish bone implement
to have been used in some processes of weaving. In like manner
all of the Californian bone saws agree thoroughly with this supposed
use.<a id='r144'/><a href='#f144' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[144]</span></sup></a> In California many valuable feather girdles have
been made, in the weaving of which these bone implements may
have been used.<a id='r145'/><a href='#f145' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[145]</span></sup></a> The exact mode of their use is not yet determined,
but it is to be hoped, however, that even this may some
time or other be discovered.</p>

The stone points with saw-like teeth on the edge do not represent technically
such an implement as a saw since the toothing is only a result of the
method of reproduction.</p>

Recently a great deal has been written about the relation of widely
separated peoples to each other. And this relationship has usually followed
definite geographic lines. It is, however, worth while to notice the great
similarity between the implements of eastern and western United States, and
those of the caves of Switzerland and of the Arctic region. Many implements
of similar type and use are to be found in these regions, implements
which are not discovered in any other portion of the world.</p>

</div>

<h4>7. Various Implements and Objects of Bone.</h4>

<p>It naturally occurs that in a shellmound in which so many
implements of bone have been preserved there would be a
number of bone objects the use of which can only be imperfectly
determined. These implements are in part possibly only attempts
to work bone, in part they are actually implements which
had a use somewhat different from that of the other forms and a
use for which the character of the material especially fitted them.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>Figs. 32 and 33. × 1/2. Bone artifacts of unknown use.</p>
</div>

<p>Many fragments of bone show only a few cuts or marks as
indications that they were worked. In one case, 1-8527, fig. 32,
stratum IX, the marks which vary somewhat from those in the
other strata may represent an implement of the paper-cutter
type. The point is in this case calcined, as is also true of many
other implements. This is evidently done intentionally, possibly
in order to work the bone more easily. Other common bone fragments
look as if they had occasionally been used as implements
when they happened to have the right form, and that they were
not intentionally worked into this shape. Still other bone fragments
show knife-like incisions on the other edges, as, for example,
that shown in fig. 33, 1-8877, stratum VII<span class='it'>a</span>. They are
probably not to be considered as marks of dog’s teeth, as which
these could also be determined, for they are generally very numerous
in one place or else they show exceeding regularity as if
made intentionally.</p>

<p>The shellmound dwellers did not fail to notice the peculiar
character of the tubular bones, which when cut into sections are
easily made into small receptacles, similar to the cane plant, which
is used in a similar manner by the inhabitants of tropical regions
(for instance by the ancient Peruvians). Many such small objects
with differing proportions were found, two of which are
shown in fig. 34. 1-8922, stratum VIII; and fig. 35, 1-9076, stratum
X.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<h3>Implements of Antler.</h3>

<p>For many kinds of implements antler is particularly valuable
on account of its hardness. For this reason a number of implements
of this character have been found in the shellmound; they
are, however, not so numerous as those of bone. They are usually
made of deer or elk antler.</p>

<h4>1. Chisel-like Implements.</h4>

<p>Of these there are two principal types.</p>

<h4>a. Actual Chisels.</h4>

<p>About half of the objects of antler are to be considered as
complete implements. These are shown in <a href='#pl8'>pl. 8</a>, figs. 2<span class='it'>a</span> and 2<span class='it'>b</span>,
1-8892, stratum VIII; figs. 3<span class='it'>a</span> and 3<span class='it'>b</span>, 1-8821, from stratum
VII<span class='it'>a</span>, represent the two subspecies of the same, <span class='it'>viz.</span>, broad and
narrow chisels. The main difference between the two is simply
one of size and proportion.</p>

<p>The broad chisels are represented by about ten objects, which
belong to the middle and lower strata of the mound only, down
to the Xth stratum. Whether this is accidental or caused by
other reasons remains undecided. These objects are from four
and one-half to five and one-half inches long, to one and three-fourths
inches broad, and even as thick as one and one-quarter
inches. Oval in cross section, they slightly diminish toward the
lower end. Frequently they pass one to two inches above the
lower end into the flat, knife-like, one-sided slope, ending in a
semi-circular edge about one inch broad. The sloping surface as
well as the polished sides of the implement frequently have impressions
due to actual use upon hard objects. In a similar manner,
the straight surface is broken by the use of a hammer which
was struck upon it.</p>

<p>The narrow chisels are represented only by one complete specimen
(<a href='#pl8'>pl. 8, fig. 3</a>) and two fragments of the knife-edge. The
latter were found between strata VII<span class='it'>a</span> and IX. The complete
chisel is only three and nine-sixteenths inches long; while it is
one and three-sixteenths inches broad at the upper end, and but
seven-sixteenths of an inch thick, it nevertheless diminishes toward
the lower end to a breadth of three-eighths of an inch at the
knife-edge. The slope of the one side toward the latter is by far
shorter than that of the broad chisel, and yet the same indications
of its use with a hammer can be found. The curvature of the
cross section of this implement corresponds to the natural form
of the antler from which it was made.</p>

<p>Such chisels<a id='r146'/><a href='#f146' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[146]</span></sup></a> partly took the place of an axe in woodwork
among the Indians, just as, for example, this was still the case
among the Hupa during the eighties of the last century,<a id='r147'/><a href='#f147' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[147]</span></sup></a> in the
construction of houses. The Klamaths in Oregon still make use
of such chisels. The better known implements of recent times
possess only the natural surface of the original antler.</p>

<p>It is of interest to know that implements of exactly the same
kind were found in the shellmounds of the Atlantic coast, <span class='it'>e.g.</span>,
in Maine.<a id='r148'/><a href='#f148' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[148]</span></sup></a></p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span></p>

<h4>b. Chisel-like Implements of Varying Forms.</h4>

<p>Implement 1-8730, <a href='#pl8'>pl. 8, fig. 1</a>, found in stratum V, has a
length of nine and three-fourths inches and a breadth of one and
seven-eighths and one and five-sixteenth inches. It will be seen
that though of greater length and breadth it is flatter than the
preceding. On account of its origin from a complete antler it is
curved along its length, and slightly curved in on its concave
side. At the lower end of the latter it is given a straight slant
for three and a quarter inches in the diameter of the breadth.
Its upper end shows the same signs of use with a hammer, while
the slanting surface is greatly worn on the sides. This makes it
probable that the use of this tool was in many respects different
from the preceding. It was possibly used as a lever.</p>

<p>For this also a parallel exists in the form of an apparently
identical implement from the shellmounds in Maine.<a id='r149'/><a href='#f149' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[149]</span></sup></a> As regards
form, certain implements of the bones of cattle found in the
caves of French Switzerland are similar to this object. Rauch
calls them “leather-cutters” (Lederschneidemesser).<a id='r150'/><a href='#f150' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[150]</span></sup></a></p>

<h4>2. Implements of Antlers with Dull, Rounded Ends.</h4>

<p>Three such objects have been found. One of them is seven
and one-eighth inches long, diminishing, horn-like, toward the
blunt point. It came from the middle stratum of the mound. It
is represented in <a href='#pl8'>pl. 8, fig. 7</a>. Another is a young branch of an
antler, and the third is a mere fragment. The use of these objects,
which were doubtless implements, cannot be conjectured.</p>

<h4>3. Pointed Implements.</h4>

<p>Only one fragmentary blade exists, about one inch long.</p>

<h4>4. Straight, Truncated Implements.</h4>

<p>Two specimens of this kind came from stratum V of the
mound. They are wanting in other parts of the mound. One of
them is reproduced in <a href='#pl8'>pl. 8, fig. 4</a>. It diminishes, horn-like, toward
the lower end. Here it is truncated abruptly, having a
breadth of five-eighths inches. Unfortunately the upper end is
incomplete. The other implement, 1-8722, is absolutely identical
with the one just described.</p>

<p>The collection contains also a fragmentary bone tool, 1-9066,
which was found in stratum X. It may have corresponded to
the peculiar implement, reproduced by J. Wyman,<a id='r151'/><a href='#f151' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[151]</span></sup></a> pl. 14, fig. 3
(with the spiral cuts at the upper end), which was found in the
shellmounds of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<h3>Implements of Tooth.</h3>

<p>Only one object made of tooth was found, <span class='it'>viz.</span>, 1-8736, fig. 36,
in stratum V. It is a bear’s tooth perforated at the root, serving
the purpose of ornament or amulet, and corresponds exactly to
the typical illustration of the one from New Jersey;<a id='r152'/><a href='#f152' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[152]</span></sup></a> here Abbott
emphasizes the fact that such ornaments were the most
common among the earlier and present-day Indians.</p>

<h2><a id='shell'></a>C. Implements Made of Shells.</h2>

<p>The objects of this material mentioned among the grave finds
are supplemented by two implements, one of which came from the
IInd, the other from the VIIIth stratum of the mound. Both are
made of the haliotis shell, the material preferred for ornamental
purposes by the Indians throughout the country. Recovered in
different strata, they differ completely with respect to their form.
Yet, owing to the scarcity of the finds we are not permitted to
advance the opinion that the form of one was limited in its stratum
to the complete exclusion of the other.</p>

<p>1-8632, fig. 37, from stratum II, is about as long as broad,
but rounded off at the lower part, while the upper rim is cut off
straight. The three-sixteenths inch wide perforations in one row
on the upper rim served for the purpose of suspending.</p>

<p>1-9106, fig. 38, from stratum VIII, represents the broken edge
of a larger ornamental plate which was originally triangular or
of a quadrilateral shape. The edge is now trapezoidal. Two of
the four sides still show the well-worked rims, ornamented with
indentations, of the original ornamental plate. The two other
sides are rough surfaces of fracture.<a id='r153'/><a href='#f153' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[153]</span></sup></a></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
